(1) 	 Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable 

intangible assets (including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of 
applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible 
common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable investors and others 
to assess the Company's use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see the "Capital Management – 
Tangible Common Equity" section in this Report. 

(2) 	 The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 
(3) 	 Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and 

others to assess the Company's ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. 

(4) 	 Consumer and small business banking deposits are total deposits excluding mortgage escrow and wholesale deposits. 
(5) 	 The risk-based capital ratios presented at September 30 and June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015 were calculated under the lower of Standardized or Advanced 

Approach determined pursuant to Basel III with Transition Requirements. Accordingly, the total capital ratio was calculated under the Advanced Approach and the other 
ratios were calculated under the Standardized Approach, for each of the periods, respectively. 

(6) 	 See the "Capital Management" section and Note 19 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information. 
(7) 	 Book value per common share is common stockholders' equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity 

divided by common shares outstanding.

Financial Review 
 
Overview 
Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified, community-based 
financial services company with $1.9 trillion in assets. Founded 
in 1852 and headquartered in San Francisco, we provide banking, 
insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and 
commercial finance through more than 8,600 locations, 
13,000 ATMs, digital (online, mobile and social), and contact 
centers (phone, email and correspondence), and we have offices 
in 42 countries and territories to support customers who conduct 
business in the global economy. With approximately 269,000 
active, full-time equivalent team members, we serve one in three 
households in the United States and ranked No. 27 on 
Fortune’s 2016 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We 
ranked third in assets and second in the market value of our 
common stock among all U.S. banks at September 30, 2016. 

The Independent Directors of the Board have retained the 
law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP to assist in its 
investigation into the Company's retail banking sales 
practices and related matters. 
An extensive review was performed by an independent 
consulting firm going back to 2011, which was completed 
prior to these settlements. This review was conducted to 
identify financial harm stemming from potentially 
unauthorized accounts. The review identified approximately 
2.1 million potentially unauthorized consumer and small 
business accounts, including 623,000 consumer and small 
business unsecured credit card accounts. As a result of this 
review, $2.6 million has been refunded to customers for any 
fees associated with the potentially unauthorized accounts. 
Since the announcement of the settlements, the review has 
been voluntarily expanded to include 2009 and 2010. 
Changes in senior management: 

retail customers received products and services they did not 
request. The amount of the settlements, which was fully accrued 
for as of June 30, 2016, totaled $185 million, plus $5 million in 
customer remediation. Our commitment to addressing the 
concerns raised by these settlements has included: 
• 	

• 	

We use our Vision and Values to guide us toward growth and 

success. Our vision is to satisfy our customers’ financial needs, 
help them succeed financially, be recognized as the premier 
financial services company in our markets and be one of 
America’s great companies. We aspire to create deep and 
enduring relationships with our customers by providing them 
with an exceptional experience and by discovering their needs 
and delivering the most relevant products, services, advice, and 
guidance. 

We have five primary values, which are based on our vision 
and provide the foundation for everything we do. First, we value 
and support our people as a competitive advantage and strive to 
attract, develop, retain and motivate the most talented people we 
can find. Second, we strive for the highest ethical standards with 
our team members, our customers, our communities and our 
shareholders. Third, with respect to our customers, we strive to 
base our decisions and actions on what is right for them in 
everything we do. Fourth, for team members we strive to build 
and sustain a diverse and inclusive culture – one where they feel 
valued and respected for who they are as well as for the skills and 
experiences they bring to our company. Fifth, we also look to 
each of our team members to be leaders in establishing, sharing 
and communicating our vision. In addition to our five primary 
values, one of our key day-to-day priorities is to make risk 
management a competitive advantage by working hard to ensure 
that appropriate controls are in place to reduce risks to our 
customers, maintain and increase our competitive market 
position, and protect Wells Fargo’s long-term safety, soundness 
and reputation. 

Sales Practices Matters 
On September 8, 2016, we announced settlements with the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Office of the Los 
Angeles City Attorney regarding allegations that some of our 

•

John Stumpf retired and has been replaced by Tim 
Sloan as CEO and Stephen Sanger, an independent 
member of the Board, as Chairman. Consistent with his 
recommendation, Mr. Stumpf forfeited unvested equity 
awards valued at approximately $41 million. 
Carrie Tolstedt left the Company and has been replaced 
by Mary Mack as head of Community Banking. Ms. 
Tolstedt forfeited unvested equity awards valued at 
approximately $19 million, will not receive severance or 
retirement enhancements in connection with her 
separation from the Company, and has agreed not to 
exercise vested options during the investigation by the 
Independent Directors of the Board. 
Neither executive will receive a bonus for 2016. 

Eliminated product sales goals for retail banking team 
members. Implemented interim incentive-based 
compensation plans in retail banking for fourth quarter 
2016. Management continues to review incentive-based 
compensation practices in retail banking. 
Implemented procedures to send retail banking customers a 
confirmation email approximately an hour after opening a 
checking or savings account and an acknowledgment letter 
after submitting a credit card application. 
Attempting to contact all retail and small business deposit 
customers across the country, including those who have 
already received refunded fees, to invite them to review their 
accounts with their banker. Also contacting credit card 
customers identified as possibly having unauthorized 
accounts to confirm whether they need or want their credit 
card.

Investments in enhanced team member training and 
monitoring and controls have been made, including 
reinforcement of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
and our EthicsLine. 
Evaluation of potential credit score and related impacts to 
customers to develop a plan for regulatory approval. 
Expanding branch-based customer experience surveys and 
instituted mystery shopper program. 

As we move forward we have a specific action plan in place 

that is focused on outreach to everyone who has been affected by 
retail banking sales practices including our community, our 
customers, our regulators, our team members and our investors. 
For additional information regarding sales practices matters, 
including related legal matters, see the "Earnings Performance – 
Operating Segment Results – Cross-sell" and “Risk Factors” 
sections and Note 11 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in 
this Report. 

 

Financial Performance 
Wells Fargo net income was $5.6 billion in third quarter 2016 
 
with diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $1.03, 
compared with $5.8 billion and $1.05, respectively, a year ago. 
We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than 
$5 billion for 16 consecutive quarters, which reflected the ability 
of our diversified business model and risk discipline to generate 
consistent financial performance during a period that included 
persistent low interest rates, market volatility and economic 
uncertainty. We remain focused on meeting the financial needs of 
our customers and on investing in our businesses so we may 
continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers in the 
future.

Compared with a year ago: 
revenue was $22.3 billion, up 2%, with growth in net interest 
income despite equity investment gains being at a five 
quarter low and $780 million lower than a year ago; 
noninterest expense increased driven by higher personnel 
expenses and higher operating lease expense due to the GE 
Capital business acquisitions; 
our investment securities reached a record $390.8 billion, an 
increase of $45.8 billion, or 13%; 
our total loans reached a high of $961.3 billion, an increase 
of $58.1 billion, or 6%; 
our deposit franchise generated strong customer and balance 
growth, with total deposits reaching a record $1.28 trillion, 
up $73.7 billion, or 6%, and we grew the number of primary 
consumer checking customers by 4.7% (August 2016 
compared with August 2015); and 
our solid capital position enabled us to return $3.2 billion to 
shareholders through common stock dividends and net share 
repurchases, the fifth consecutive quarter of returning more 
than $3 billion. 

Balance Sheet and Liquidity 
Our balance sheet maintained its strength in third quarter 2016 
 
as we increased our liquidity position, generated loan, investment 
securities and deposit growth, experienced solid credit quality 
and maintained strong capital levels. We have been able to grow 
our loans on a year-over-year basis for 21 consecutive quarters 
(for the past 18 quarters year-over-year loan growth has been 3% 
or greater). Our loan portfolio increased $44.8 billion from 
December 31, 2015, predominantly due to growth in commercial 
and industrial, real estate mortgage, real estate construction and 
lease financing loans within the commercial loan portfolio 
segment, which included $26.5 billion of commercial and 

4 

industrial loans and capital leases acquired from GE Capital in 
the first nine months of 2016. 

With the expectation of interest rates remaining lower for a 

longer period, we grew our investment securities portfolio by 
$43.3 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2015, with 
approximately $57 billion of gross purchases during third quarter 
2016, compared with last year's average of $26 billion per 
quarter. The amount of investment securities purchased was 
higher than in prior quarters due to the fact that we did not add 
duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps, as we had 
in prior quarters. 

Our funding sources grew in third quarter 2016 with long­

term debt up $55.3 billion from December 31, 2015, on 
$19.7 billion of issuances in third quarter 2016, including 
$9.2 billion that we anticipate will be Total Loss Absorbing 
Capacity (TLAC) eligible. Deposit growth continued in the first 
nine months of 2016 with period-end deposits up $52.6 billion, 
or 4%, from December 31, 2015. Our average deposit cost in third 
quarter 2016 was 11 basis points, up 3 basis points from a year 
ago, which reflected an increase in deposit pricing for certain 
wholesale banking customers. We successfully grew our primary 
consumer checking customers (i.e., customers who actively use 
their checking account with transactions such as debit card 
purchases, online bill payments, and direct deposit) by 4.7% 
(August 2016 compared with August 2015). 

Credit Quality 
Solid overall credit results continued in third quarter 2016 as 
losses remained low and we continued to originate high quality 
loans, reflecting our long-term risk focus. Net charge-offs were 
$805 million, or 0.33% (annualized) of average loans, in third 
quarter 2016, compared with $703 million a year ago (0.31%). 
The increase in net charge-offs in third quarter 2016, compared 
with a year ago, was predominantly due to continued challenges 
in the oil and gas portfolio. However, our total oil and gas loan 
exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans 
outstanding, was down 10% from a year ago. 

Our commercial portfolio net charge-offs were $215 million, 

or 17 basis points of average commercial loans, in third quarter 
2016, compared with net charge-offs of $94 million, or 8 basis 
points, a year ago. Net consumer credit losses declined to 51 basis 
points of average consumer loans in third quarter 2016 from 
53 basis points in third quarter 2015. Our commercial real estate 
portfolios were in a net recovery position for the 15th consecutive 
quarter, reflecting our conservative risk discipline and improved 
market conditions. Losses on our consumer real estate portfolios 
declined $82 million from a year ago, down 54%. The lower 
consumer loss levels reflected the benefit of the continued 
improvement in the housing market and our continued focus on 
originating high quality loans. Approximately 72% of the 
consumer first mortgage portfolio was originated after 2008, 
when more stringent underwriting standards were implemented. 

The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2016, 

increased $132 million compared with a year ago. The allowance 
coverage for total loans was 1.32% at September 30, 2016, 
compared with 1.39% a year ago. The allowance covered 
4.0 times annualized third quarter net charge-offs, compared 
with 4.5 times a year ago. Future allowance levels will be based 
on a variety of factors, including loan growth, portfolio 
performance and general economic conditions. Our provision for 
loan losses was $805 million in third quarter 2016, up from 
$703 million a year ago, reflecting losses in the oil and gas 
portfolio and the loan growth mentioned above. 

Nonperforming assets decreased $1.1 billion, or 8%, from 

June 30, 2016 with improvement across our consumer and 

commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. 
Nonperforming assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest 
level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. Nonaccrual loans 
decreased $977 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a 
$732 million decrease in consumer nonaccruals. In addition, 
foreclosed assets were down $97 million from the prior quarter. 
During the first week of October 2016, Hurricane Matthew 

caused destruction along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South 
Carolina and North Carolina and resulted in, among other things, 
property damage for our customers and the closing of many 
businesses. We are currently assessing the impact to our 
customers and our business as a result of Hurricane Matthew. 
The financial impact to us is expected to primarily relate to our 
consumer real estate, commercial real estate and auto loan 
portfolios and will depend on a number of factors, including the 
types of loans most affected by the hurricane, the extent of 
damage to our collateral, the extent of available insurance 
coverage, the availability of government assistance for our 
borrowers, and whether our borrowers’ ability to repay their 
loans has been diminished. 

Capital 
Our financial performance in third quarter 2016 resulted in 
strong capital generation, which increased total equity to a record 
$204.0 billion at September 30, 2016, up $1.3 billion from the 
prior quarter. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in third 
quarter 2016 through common stock dividends and net share 
repurchases and our net payout ratio (which is the ratio of (i) 
common stock dividends and share repurchases less issuances 
and stock compensation-related items, divided by (ii) net income 
applicable to common stock) was 61%, compared with 62% in the 
prior quarter, and within our targeted range of 55-75%. We 
continued to reduce our common share count through the 
repurchase of 38.3 million common shares in the quarter. We 
also entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contract 
with an unrelated third party in October 2016 that is expected to 
settle in first quarter 2017 for approximately 17 million shares. 
 
We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through 
share repurchases throughout the remainder of 2016. 

We believe an important measure of our capital strength is 
the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, fully phased-in, 
which was 10.71% at September 30, 2016. Likewise, our other 
regulatory capital ratios remained strong. See the “Capital 
Management” section in this Report for more information 
regarding our capital, including the calculation of our regulatory 
capital amounts.

Earnings Performance 

Wells Fargo net income for third quarter 2016 was $5.6 billion 
 
($1.03 diluted earnings per common share), compared with 
$5.8 billion ($1.05 diluted per share) for third quarter 2015. Net 
income for the first nine months of 2016 was $16.7 billion 
 
($3.03), compared with $17.3 billion ($3.12) for the same period 
a year ago. Our third quarter and first nine months of 2016 
 
earnings reflected continued execution of our business strategy as 
we continued to satisfy our customers' financial needs. We 
generated revenue growth across many of our businesses and 
grew loans and deposits. Our financial performance in the first 
nine months of 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, 
benefited from a $1.6 billion increase in net interest income, 
which was offset by a $1.4 billion increase in our provision for 
credit losses and a $1.8 billion increase in noninterest expense. 
The key drivers of our financial performance in the third quarter 
and first nine months of 2016 were balanced net interest income 
and noninterest income, diversified sources of fee income, and a 
diversified and growing loan portfolio. 

Revenue, the sum of net interest income and noninterest 

income, was $22.3 billion in third quarter 2016, compared with 
$21.9 billion in third quarter 2015. Revenue for the first nine 
months of 2016 was $66.7 billion, up 3% from the first nine 
months of 2015. The increase in revenue for the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2016, compared with the same periods in 
2015, was largely due to an increase in net interest income, 
reflecting increases in interest income from loans and trading 
assets, partially offset by higher long-term debt and deposit 
interest expense. In the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, net interest income represented 54% and 53% of revenue, 
respectively, compared with 52% for both periods in 2015. 

Noninterest income was $10.38 billion and $31.33 billion in 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, representing 46% 
 
and 47% of revenue, respectively, compared with $10.42 billion 
 
(48%) and $30.76 billion (48%) in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2015. Noninterest income in third quarter 2016 
 
decreased $42 million, compared with the same period in 2015, 
predominantly due to lower net gains on equity investments and 
insurance, partially offset by an increase in net gains from trading 
activities and lease income. Noninterest income for the first nine 
months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, 
reflected an increase in lease income related to the GE Capital 
business acquisitions, gains from the sale of our crop insurance 
and health benefit services businesses, and hedge ineffectiveness 
income, primarily on our long-term debt hedges, partially offset 
by lower trust and investment fees, and net gains on equity 
investments. 

Noninterest expense was $13.3 billion and $39.2 billion in 

the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with $12.4 billion and $37.4 billion for the same 
periods in 2015. The increase in noninterest expense for the third 
 
quarter and first nine months of 2016, compared with the same 
periods in 2015, was predominantly due to higher personnel 
expenses, operating lease expense, FDIC and other deposit 
assessments, and outside professional services and contract 
services, as well as increased operating losses, reflecting higher 
litigation accruals, partially offset by lower foreclosed assets 
expense, insurance and outside data processing. Noninterest 
expense as a percentage of revenue (efficiency ratio) was 59.4% in 
third quarter 2016 (58.7% in the first nine months of 2016), 
compared with 56.7% in third quarter 2015 (58.0% in the first 
nine months of 2015). 

During first quarter 2016, we closed substantially all of the 

6 

acquisition of certain commercial lending businesses and assets 
from GE Capital. A portion of the assets were acquired in January 
2016 with additional assets acquired in March 2016. In third 
 
quarter 2016, we closed the acquisition of the Asia, Australia, and 
New Zealand segments of GE Capital’s Commercial Distribution 
Finance business. In October 2016, the final phase of our GE 
Capital business acquisitions was completed when we closed the 
acquisition of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa segments of 
the GE Capital Commercial Distribution Finance business. 
 
Net Interest Income 
Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, 
loans (including yield-related loan fees) and other interest-
earning assets minus the interest paid on deposits, short-term 
borrowings and long-term debt. The net interest margin is the 
average yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate 
paid for deposits and our other sources of funding. Net interest 
income and the net interest margin are presented on a taxable-
equivalent basis in Table 1 to consistently reflect income from 
taxable and tax-exempt loans and securities based on a 35% 
federal statutory tax rate. 

While the Company believes that it has the ability to increase 

net interest income over time, net interest income and the net 
interest margin in any one period can be significantly affected by 
a variety of factors including the mix and overall size of our 
earning assets portfolio and the cost of funding those assets. In 
addition, some variable sources of interest income, such as 
resolutions from purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, loan fees 
and collection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can vary from 
period to period. Net interest income and net interest margin 
growth has been challenged during the prolonged low interest 
rate environment as higher yielding loans and securities have run 
off and been replaced with lower yielding assets. 

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was 

$12.3 billion and $36.3 billion in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, respectively, compared with $11.7 billion and 
$34.5 billion for the same periods a year ago. The net interest 
margin was 2.82% and 2.86% for the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, down from 2.96% for both the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2015. The increase in net interest income in 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 from the same 
periods a year ago resulted from an increase in interest income, 
partially offset by an increase in funding interest expense. The 
increase in interest income was driven by growth in commercial 
and consumer loans, including the GE Capital business 
acquisitions that closed in 2016, growth in investment securities, 
increased trading income and higher short-term interest rates. 
Funding interest expense increased in the third quarter and first 
nine months of 2016, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
primarily due to growth and repricing of long-term debt. Deposit 
interest expense was also higher, predominantly due to an 
increase in wholesale pricing resulting from higher short-term 
interest rates. 

The decline in net interest margin in the third quarter and 

first nine months of 2016, compared with the same periods a year 
ago, was primarily due to deposit growth and higher long-term 
debt balances, including debt issued to fund the GE Capital 
business acquisitions. As a result of growth in funding balances, 
net interest margin was diluted by an increase in cash, federal 
funds sold, and other short-term investments, which was 
partially offset by growth in loans, trading, and the benefit of 
higher short-term interest rates. 

 Average earning assets increased $158.4 billion and 

$135.5 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago, as 
average loans increased $62.4 billion in the third quarter and 
$68.8 billion in the first nine months of 2016, average investment 
securities increased $24.2 billion in the third quarter and 
$21.5 billion in the first nine months of 2016, and average trading 
assets increased $21.6 billion in the third quarter and 
$17.6 billion in the first nine months of 2016, compared with the 
same periods a year ago. In addition, average federal funds sold 
and other short-term investments increased $49.2 billion and 
$28.4 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, 
respectively, compared with the same periods a year ago. 

Deposits are an important low-cost source of funding and 

affect both net interest income and the net interest margin. 
Deposits include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing 
checking, market rate and other savings, savings certificates, 
other time deposits, and deposits in foreign offices. Average 
deposits of $1.26 trillion increased in third quarter 2016 
 
($1.24 trillion in the first nine months of 2016), compared with 
$1.20 trillion in third quarter 2015 ($1.19 trillion in the first nine 
months of 2015), and represented 132% of average loans in third 
quarter 2016 (131% in the first nine months of 2016), compared 
with 134% and 135% for the same periods a year ago. Average 
deposits decreased to 73% of average earning assets in both the 
third quarter and first nine months of 2016, compared with 76% 
 
for the same periods a year ago as the growth in total loans 
outpaced deposit growth.

NM- Not meaningful 
(1)  Wire transfer and other remittance fees, reflected in all other fees prior to 2016, have been separately disclosed. 
(2)  All other fees have been revised to include merchant processing fees for all periods presented. 
(3)  Effective fourth quarter 2015, the Company's proportionate share of its merchant services joint venture earnings is included in All other income. 

Noninterest income was $10.38 billion and $31.33 billion for the 
third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with $10.42 billion and $30.76 billion for the same 
periods a year ago. This income represented 46% and 47% of 
revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, 
respectively, compared with 48% for both the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2015. The decline in noninterest income in 
third quarter 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, 
was due to lower net gains on equity investments and insurance, 
partially offset by an increase in net gains from trading activities 
and lease income. The increase in noninterest income for the first 
nine months of 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, 
was driven by higher lease income related to the GE Capital 
business acquisitions, gains from the sale of our crop insurance 
and health benefit services businesses, and hedge ineffectiveness 
income primarily on our long-term debt hedges, partially offset 
by lower trust and investment fees, and net gains on equity 
investments. Many of our businesses, including consumer and 
small business deposits, credit and debit cards, capital markets, 
international, community lending, multi-family capital, corporate 
trust, equipment finance, and structured real estate, grew 
noninterest income in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016. 

10 

Service charges on deposit accounts were $1.37 billion and 
$4.02 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, 
respectively, compared with $1.34 billion and $3.84 billion in the 
 
third quarter and first nine months of 2015. The increase in third 
quarter 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
driven by account growth and higher overdraft fee revenue, while 
the increase in the first nine months of 2016, compared with the 
same period a year ago, was driven by higher overdraft fee 
revenue, account growth and higher fees from commercial 
product sales and commercial product re-pricing. 

Brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees are received 

for providing full-service and discount brokerage services 
predominantly to retail brokerage clients. Income from these 
brokerage-related activities include asset-based fees for advisory 
accounts, which are based on the market value of the client’s 
assets, and transactional commissions based on the number and 
size of transactions executed at the client’s direction. These fees 
decreased to $2.3 billion and $6.9 billion in the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2016, respectively, from $2.4 billion and 
$7.1 billion for the same periods in 2015. The decrease in third 
quarter 2016 was predominantly due to lower brokerage 
transaction revenue. The decrease for the first nine months of 
2016 was due to lower brokerage transaction revenue and lower 

asset-based fees. Retail brokerage client assets totaled $1.48 
trillion at September 30, 2016, compared with $1.35 trillion at 
September 30, 2015, with all retail brokerage services provided 
by our Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating 
segment. For additional information on retail brokerage client 
assets, see the discussion and Tables 4d and 4e in the "Operating 
Segment Results – Wealth and Investment Management – Retail 
Brokerage Client Assets" section in this Report. 

We earn trust and investment management fees from 

managing and administering assets, including mutual funds, 
institutional separate accounts, corporate trust, personal trust, 
employee benefit trust and agency assets. Trust and investment 
management fee income is primarily from client assets under 
management (AUM) for which the fees are determined based on 
a tiered scale relative to the market value of the AUM. AUM 
consists of assets for which we have investment management 
discretion. Our AUM totaled $667.5 billion at September 30, 
2016, compared with $639.9 billion at September 30, 2015, with 
substantially all of our AUM managed by our WIM operating 
segment. Additional information regarding our WIM operating 
segment AUM is provided in Table 4f and the related discussion 
in the "Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment 
Management – Trust and Investment Client Assets Under 
Management" section in this Report. In addition to AUM we have 
client assets under administration (AUA) that earn various 
administrative fees which are generally based on the type of 
services provided to administer the account. Our AUA totaled 
$1.55 trillion at September 30, 2016, compared with $1.52 trillion 
at September 30, 2015. Trust and investment management fees 
increased $6 million to $849 million in third quarter 2016, but 
decreased $57 million to $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 
2016. The decrease in the first nine months of 2016 was due to 
lower average AUM and a shift of assets into lower yielding 
products. 

We earn investment banking fees from underwriting debt 

and equity securities, arranging loan syndications, and 
performing other related advisory services. Investment banking 
fees increased to $420 million in third quarter 2016 from 
$359 million in third quarter 2015 driven by higher fee income 
across all products. Investment banking fees decreased to $1.2 
billion in the first nine months of 2016 from $1.3 billion in the 
same period a year ago driven by declines in debt and equity 
originations due to market volatility. 

Card fees were $997 million and $2.9 billion in the third 
 
quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with $953 million and $2.8 billion for the same periods a year 
ago. The increase was predominantly due to account growth and 
increased purchase activity. 

Other fees decreased to $926 million and $2.8 billion in the 

third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, from 
$1.1 billion and $3.3 billion for the same periods in 2015, 
predominantly driven by lower all other fees. All other fees were 
$179 million and $562 million in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, respectively, compared with $348 million and 
$1.0 billion for the same periods in 2015. The decrease was 
predominantly due to the deconsolidation of our merchant 
services joint venture in fourth quarter 2015, which resulted in a 
proportionate share of that income now being reported in all 
other income. 

Mortgage banking noninterest income, consisting of net 

servicing income and net gains on loan origination/sales 
activities, totaled $1.7 billion and $4.7 billion in the third quarter 
and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared with 
$1.6 billion and $4.8 billion for the same periods a year ago. 
In addition to servicing fees, net mortgage loan servicing 

income includes amortization of commercial mortgage servicing 
rights (MSRs), changes in the fair value of residential MSRs 
during the period, as well as changes in the value of derivatives 
(economic hedges) used to hedge the residential MSRs. Net 
servicing income of $359 million for third quarter 2016 included 
a $134 million net MSR valuation gain ($8 million decrease in the 
fair value of the MSRs and a $142 million hedge gain). Net 
servicing income of $674 million for third quarter 2015 included 
a $253 million net MSR valuation gain ($833 million decrease in 
the fair value of the MSRs and a $1.1 billion hedge gain). For the 
first nine months of 2016, net servicing income of $1.6 billion 
 
included a $786 million net MSR valuation gain ($1.8 billion 
 
decrease in the fair value of the MSRs and a $2.6 billion hedge 
gain) and for the same period in 2015 net servicing income of 
$1.7 billion included a $468 million net MSR valuation gain 
($553 million decrease in the fair value of the MSRs and a $1.0 
billion hedge gain). Net servicing income decreased in third 
 
quarter 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, from 
lower net MSR valuation gains, higher unreimbursed servicing 
costs related to FHA loans, lower contractual servicing fees due to 
servicing portfolio runoff and higher other changes in MSR fair 
value losses due to higher payoffs in third quarter 2016. The 
increase in net MSR valuation gains in the first nine months of 
2016, compared with the same period in 2015, was 
predominantly attributable to MSR valuation adjustments in first 
quarter 2015 that reflected higher prepayment expectations due 
to the reduction in FHA mortgage insurance premiums as well as 
a reduction in forecasted prepayments in the first nine months of 
2016 due to updated economic and mortgage market rate inputs. 
Our portfolio of loans serviced for others was $1.70 trillion at 

September 30, 2016, and $1.78 trillion at December 31, 2015. At 
September 30, 2016, the ratio of combined residential and 
commercial MSRs to related loans serviced for others was 0.69%, 
compared with 0.77% at December 31, 2015. See the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking 
Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for 
additional information regarding our MSRs risks and hedging 
approach. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities was 

$1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, respectively, compared with $915 million and 
$3.1 billion for the same periods a year ago. The increase in third 
 
quarter 2016, compared with the same period a year ago, was 
primarily driven by higher originations, partially offset by lower 
production margins. Mortgage loan originations were $70 billion 
 
and $177 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, respectively, compared with $55 billion and $166 billion for 
the same periods a year ago. The production margin on 
residential held-for-sale mortgage originations, which represents 
net gains on residential mortgage loan origination/sales activities 
divided by total residential held-for-sale mortgage originations, 
provides a measure of the profitability of our residential 
mortgage origination activity. Table 2a presents the information 
used in determining the production margin.

management activities and changes in estimate to the liability for mortgage 
loan repurchase losses. 

The production margin was 1.81% and 1.72% for the third 
 
quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with 1.88% and 1.85% for the same periods a year ago. Mortgage 
 
applications were $100 billion and $272 billion for the third 
quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with $73 billion and $247 billion for the same periods a year ago. 
The 1-4 family first mortgage unclosed pipeline was $50 billion at 
September 30, 2016, compared with $34 billion at September 30, 
2015. For additional information about our mortgage banking 
activities and results, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Risk” section and Note 8 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and 
Note 13 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Net gains on mortgage loan origination/sales activities 

include adjustments to the mortgage repurchase liability. 
Mortgage loans are repurchased from third parties based on 
standard representations and warranties, and early payment 
default clauses in mortgage sale contracts. For the first nine 
months of 2016, we released a net $106 million from the 
repurchase liability, including $13 million in third quarter 2016, 
compared with a net $40 million release for the first nine months 
of 2015, including $6 million in third quarter 2015. For 
additional information about mortgage loan repurchases, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability for 
Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses” section and Note 8 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Net gains from trading activities, which reflect both 

unrealized changes in fair value of our trading positions and 
 
realized gains, were $415 million and $943 million in the third 
quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with $(26) million and $515 million for the same periods a year 
ago. The increase in the third quarter and the first nine months of 
2016 was predominantly driven by higher deferred compensation 
gains (offset in employee benefits expense) and higher customer 
accommodation trading activity within our capital markets 
business reflecting higher fixed income trading gains. Net gains 
from trading activities do not include interest and dividend 
income and expense on trading securities. Those amounts are 
reported within interest income from trading assets and other 
interest expense from trading liabilities. For additional 
information about our trading activities, see the “Risk 
Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – 
Trading Activities” section in this Report. 

Net gains on debt and equity securities totaled $246 million 
 

and $1.4 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, respectively, compared with $1.1 billion and $2.4 billion for 
the same periods in 2015, after other-than-temporary 
impairment (OTTI) write-downs of $136 million and $464 
million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months 
of 2016, compared with $140 million and $308 million for the 
same periods in 2015. The decrease in net gains on debt and 
equity securities in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, compared with the same periods a year ago, reflected lower 
net gains from equity investments as our portfolio benefited from 
strong public and private equity markets in 2015. 

Lease income was $534 million and $1.4 billion in the third 
 

quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with $189 million and $476 million for the same periods a year 
ago, largely driven by the GE Capital business acquisitions. 

All other income was $163 million and $1.2 billion in the 

third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with $116 million and $(28) million for the same 
periods a year ago. All other income includes ineffectiveness 
recognized on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, the 
results of certain economic hedges, losses on low income housing 
tax credit investments, foreign currency adjustments, and income 
from investments accounted for under the equity method, any of 
which can cause decreases and net losses in other income. The 
increase in other income for the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, compared with the same periods a year ago, 
reflected changes in ineffectiveness recognized on interest rate 
swaps used to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on long­
term debt and cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate 
swaps and forward contracts used to hedge our exposure to 
foreign currency risk and interest rate risk involving non-U.S. 
dollar denominated long-term debt. A portion of the hedge 
ineffectiveness recognized was partially offset by the results of 
certain economic hedges and accordingly we recognized a net 
hedge benefit of $142 million and $577 million for the third 
 
quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with a net hedge gain of $109 million and $56 million for the 
same periods a year ago. Other income for the first nine months 
of 2016 also included a $381 million gain from the sale of our 
crop insurance business in first quarter 2016, and a $290 million 
gain from the sale of our health benefit services business in 
second quarter 2016. For additional information about 
derivatives used as part of our asset/liability management, see

Noninterest expense was $13.3 billion in third quarter 2016 and 
$39.2 billion in the first nine months of 2016, up 7% and 5%, 
respectively, from the same periods a year ago, driven 
predominantly by higher personnel expenses, operating lease 
expense, outside professional services and contract services, 
FDIC and other deposit assessments, and operating losses, 
partially offset by lower foreclosed assets expense, insurance, and 
outside data processing. 

Personnel expenses, which include salaries, commissions, 
incentive compensation and employee benefits, were up $507 
million, or 7%, in third quarter 2016 compared with the same 
period a year ago, and up $1.0 billion, or 4%, for the first nine 
months of 2016 compared with the same period a year ago. The 
increase in both periods was due to annual salary increases, 
higher deferred compensation expense (offset in trading 
revenue), and staffing growth driven by the GE Capital business 
acquisitions, as well as investments in risk management. The 
increase in the first nine months of 2016 was also driven by an 
extra payroll day. 

Operating lease expense was up $284 million in third 

quarter 2016 and $745 million in the first nine months of 2016, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, largely due to 
depreciation expense on the operating leases acquired from GE 
Capital. 

Outside professional services expense was up 21% and 17% in 

the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago. Contract services 
expense was up 26% and 23% in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, respectively, compared with the same periods a 
year ago. The increase in both expense categories reflected 
continued investments in our products, technology and service 
delivery, as well as costs to meet heightened regulatory 
expectations and evolving cybersecurity risk. 

FDIC and other deposit assessments were up 27% and 14% 
in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, due to an increase in 
deposit assessments as a result of a temporary surcharge which 
became effective on July 1, 2016. See the "Regulatory Reform" 
section in this Report for additional information. 

Operating losses were up 10% and 2% in the third quarter 
and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared with the 
same periods a year ago, predominantly due to higher litigation 
and compliance expense for various legal matters. 

Foreclosed assets expense was a net recovery in third quarter 

2016 compared to a net expense in the same period a year ago. 
Higher gains on sales of foreclosed properties contributed to the 
net recovery in third quarter 2016. Foreclosed assets expense was 
down 65% in the first nine months of 2016 compared with the 
same period a year ago, driven by lower operating expense and 
write-downs. 

Insurance expense was down 76% and 60% in the third 

quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared 
with the same periods a year ago, due to the sale of our crop 
insurance business in first quarter 2016 and the sale of our 
Warranty Solutions business in third quarter 2015. 

Outside data processing expense was down 10% and 15% in 

the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with the same periods a year ago, predominantly due 
to the deconsolidation of our merchant services joint venture in 
fourth quarter 2015 as well as lower card processing expense. 

All other expense in third quarter 2016 included a 

$107 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation, 
compared with $126 million in third quarter 2015. 

The efficiency ratio was 59.4% in third quarter 2016, 
compared with 56.7% in third quarter 2015. The Company 
expects the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level.

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Income Tax Expense 
Our effective tax rate was 31.5% and 32.5% for third quarter 2016 
and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for 
third quarter 2016 was largely due to an increase in tax credit 
investments, partially offset by the recognition of net changes in 
discrete tax benefits and expenses relating to tax disputes, 
settlements and uncertain tax positions. Our effective tax rate 
was 31.9% in the first nine months of 2016, up from 31.1% in the 
first nine months of 2015. The effective tax rate for the first nine 
months of 2015 reflected $359 million of discrete tax benefits 
primarily from reductions in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
due to audit resolutions of prior period matters with U.S. federal 
and state taxing authorities. 

Operating Segment Results 
We are organized for management reporting purposes into three 
operating segments: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; 
and Wealth and Investment Management (WIM). These 
segments are defined by product type and customer segment and 
their results are based on our management accounting process, 
for which there is no comprehensive, authoritative financial 
accounting guidance equivalent to generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). Table 4 and the following discussion present 
our results by operating segment. For additional description of 
our operating segments, including additional financial 
information and the underlying management accounting process, 
see Note 18 (Operating Segments) to Financial Statements in this 
Report.

Includes the elimination of certain items that are included in more than one business segment, substantially all of which represents products and services for WIM 
customers served through Community Banking distribution channels. 

  

Cross-sell  We aspire to create deep and enduring relationships 
with our customers by providing them with an exceptional 
experience and by discovering their needs and delivering the 
most relevant products, services, advice, and guidance. An 
outcome of offering customers the products and services they 
need, want and value is that we earn more opportunities to serve 
them, or what we call cross-sell. Cross-sell is the result of serving 
our customers well, understanding their financial needs and goals 
over their lifetimes, and ensuring we innovate our products, 
services and channels so that we earn more of their business and 
help them succeed financially. Our customer-focused approach to 
cross-sell is needs-based as some customers will benefit from 
more products, and some may need fewer. We believe there is 
continued opportunity to meet our customers' financial needs as 
we build lifelong relationships with them. One way we track the 
degree to which we are satisfying our customers' financial needs 
is through our cross-sell metrics, which help us measure the 
depth of relationships we have formed with our Community 
Banking, Wholesale Banking and WIM customers. For additional 
information regarding our cross-sell metrics, see the "Earnings 
Performance – Operating Segments – Cross-sell" section in our 
2015 Form 10-K. 

The “Earnings Performance – Operating Segments – Cross-
sell” section in our 2015 Form 10-K described our methodology 

14 

for measuring and tracking cross-sell metrics. As described 
below, in second quarter 2016 we modified our methodology for 
Community Banking to better align our cross-sell metrics with 
ongoing changes in Community Banking’s business and products. 
This change in methodology was unrelated to the sales practices 
settlements announced on September 8, 2016. Instead, the 
change in methodology was the result of a long-term evaluation 
spanning 18 months that explored several alternatives and 
involved product groups and lines of business in order to best 
align our Community Banking cross-sell metric with our strategic 
focus of long-term retail banking relationships. For similar 
reasons, we are currently in the process of evaluating changes in 
our cross-sell methodology for Wholesale Banking and WIM. In 
response to the sales practices settlements, however, we 
eliminated product sales goals for retail banking team members 
effective October 1, 2016. 

For Community Banking, the cross-sell metric represents the 

average number of products per retail banking household. For 
example, one checking account and two loans for the same 
household would be treated as three products for the metric. 
During second quarter 2016, we changed how we determine retail 
banking households within Community Banking to include only 
those households that have a retail (consumer) checking account, 
which we believe provides the foundation for long-term retail 

Operating Segment Results 
 
The following discussion provides a description of each of our 
operating segments, including cross-sell metrics and financial 
results. Operating segment results for 2016 reflect a shift in 
expenses between the personnel and other expense categories as 
a result of the movement of support staff from the Wholesale 
Banking and WIM segments into a consolidated organization 
within the Community Banking segment. Personnel expenses 
associated with the transferred support staff are now being 
allocated from Community Banking back to the Wholesale 
Banking and WIM segments through other expense. 

Community Banking offers a complete line of diversified 
financial products and services for consumers and small 
businesses including checking and savings accounts, credit and 
debit cards, and automobile, student, and small business lending. 
These products also include investment, insurance and trust 
services in 39 states and D.C., and mortgage and home equity 
loans in all 50 states and D.C. The Community Banking segment 
also includes the results of our Corporate Treasury activities net 
of allocations in support of the other operating segments and 
results of investments in our affiliated venture capital 
partnerships. Our retail banking household cross-sell (on the 
revised basis described above) was 6.25 products per household 
in August 2016, compared with 6.33 in August 2015, reflecting a 
one month reporting lag for each period. Table 4a provides 
additional financial information for Community Banking. 

banking relationships. Previously, retail banking households were 
defined as a household that had at least one of the following retail 
products – a checking account, savings account, savings 
certificate, individual retirement account (IRA) certificate of 
deposit, IRA savings account, personal line of credit, personal 
loan, home equity line of credit or home equity loan. We continue 
to determine a retail banking household for Community Banking 
based on aggregating all products with the same address. This 
change to how we determine retail banking households resulted 
in the removal from the cross-sell metric of approximately 
1.7 million households and over 3 million associated products. In 
order to provide a more comprehensive and holistic view of a 
retail banking household’s entire relationship with us, during 
second quarter 2016 we also updated the products included in the 
Community Banking cross-sell metrics to capture business 
products (over 6 million business products added, consisting 
primarily of checking accounts and debit cards), in addition to 
retail products, that have the potential for revenue generation 
and long-term viability. Products and services that generally do 
not meet these criteria – such as ATM cards, online banking, bill 
pay and direct deposit – are not included. The removal of bill pay, 
which was previously included, resulted in over 9 million 
products being removed from the cross-sell metric, as we believe 
bill pay is better classified as one of the many omni-channel 
services we provide. On an ongoing basis, we may periodically 
update the products included in our cross-sell metrics to account 
for changes in our product offerings. 

Our Community Banking cross-sell metrics, as revised for 

prior periods to conform to the current period presentation, were 
6.33, 6.31, 6.37 and 6.36 as of August 2015 and November 2015, 
2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a one month reporting lag 
for each period. Cross-sell metrics have not been adjusted to 
reflect the impact of approximately 2.1 million potentially 
unauthorized accounts identified in a review by an independent 
consulting firm. Due to our ongoing processes to actively monitor 
balances and usage of accounts and remove those that are 
inactive over established timeframes, not all of these potentially 
unauthorized accounts affected our cross-sell metrics at any one 
time. Accordingly, the maximum impact of these accounts to this 
reported metric in any one quarter was 0.02 products per 
household, or 0.3%.

(1)  Represents income on products and services for WIM customers served through Community Banking distribution channels and is eliminated in consolidation.

(4)  Reflects results attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily associated with the Company’s consolidated venture capital investments. 

Community Banking reported net income of $3.2 billion in 

third quarter 2016, down $333 million, or 9%, from third quarter 
2015, and $9.7 billion for the first nine months of 2016, down 
$620 million, or 6%, compared with the same period a year ago. 
Results from the first nine months of 2015 included a discrete tax 
benefit of $359 million. Revenue of $12.4 billion decreased 
$546 million, or 4%, from third quarter 2015, and revenue of 
$37.2 billion for the first nine months of 2016 increased 
$194 million, or 1%, compared with the same period last year. 
The decrease from third quarter 2015 was driven by lower gains 
on equity investments and other income, partially offset by 
higher deferred compensation plan investment results (offset in 
employee benefits expense), higher gains on debt securities, 
revenue from debit and credit card volumes, and deposit service 
charges. The increase from the first nine months of 2015 was due 
to higher net interest income, other income driven by positive 
hedge ineffectiveness, gains on debt securities, revenue from 
debit and credit card volumes, and deposit service charges, 
partially offset by lower gains on equity investments, mortgage 
banking revenue, and trust and investment fees. Average loans of 
$489.2 billion in third quarter 2016 increased $12.2 billion, or 
3%, from third quarter 2015, and average loans of $486.4 billion 
in the first nine months of 2016 increased $12.5 billion, or 3%, 
from the first nine months of 2015. Average deposits increased 
$52.4 billion, or 8%, from third quarter 2015 and $47.0 billion, 
or 7%, from the first nine months of 2015. Primary consumer 

16 

checking customers (customers who actively use their checking 
account with transactions such as debit card purchases, online 
bill payments, and direct deposit) as of August 2016 were up 4.7% 
from August 2015. Noninterest expense increased 3% from third 
quarter 2015 and increased 2% from the first nine months of 
2015. The increase from third quarter 2015 was driven by higher 
deferred compensation plan expense (offset in trading revenue) 
and operating losses, partially offset by lower foreclosed assets 
expense and other expense. The increase from the first nine 
months of 2015 was due to higher personnel expense including 
higher deferred compensation plan expense (offset in trading 
revenue), operating losses, and equipment expense, partially 
offset by lower foreclosed assets expense, data processing, and 
other expense. The provision for credit losses decreased $17 
million from third quarter 2015 due to lower net charge-offs, and 
increased $337 million from the first nine months of 2015 due to 
allowance releases in the prior year compared with an allowance 
build for the first nine months of 2016, reflecting loan growth in 
the automobile and credit card portfolios.

Wholesale Banking had net income of $2.0 billion in third 

quarter 2016, up $122 million, or 6%, from third quarter 2015. In 
the first nine months of 2016, net income of $6.0 billion 
decreased $49 million, or 1%, from the same period a year ago. 
The increase in the third quarter was driven by higher revenue, 
partially offset by higher expenses and provision for credit losses. 
The decline in the first nine months of 2016 was driven by 
increased provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, 
partially offset by increased revenue. Revenue of $7.1 billion in 
third quarter 2016 increased $821 million, or 13%, from third 
quarter 2015 and revenue of $21.4 billion in the first nine months 
of 2016 increased $2.0 billion, or 11%, from the first nine months 
of 2015 on higher net interest income and noninterest income. 
Net interest income increased $451 million, or 12%, from third 
quarter 2015 and $1.1 billion, or 10%, from the first nine months 
of 2015 driven by the GE Capital business acquisitions and broad-
based loan growth. Noninterest income increased $370 million, 
or 14%, from third quarter 2015 on higher lease income related to 
the GE Capital business acquisitions, higher customer 
accommodation trading, mortgage banking fees and investment 
banking fees, partially offset by lower gains on equity and debt 

securities, lower insurance income as a result of the sale of our 
crop insurance business in first quarter 2016, and the 
deconsolidation of our merchant services joint venture in fourth 
quarter 2015, which previously recognized a large share of 
income in all other fees. Noninterest income increased 
$1.0 billion, or 11%, from the first nine months of 2015 on higher 
lease income related to the GE Capital business acquisitions, 
gains on the sales of our crop insurance and health benefit 
services businesses, and higher customer accommodation 
trading, partially offset by lower insurance fees related to the sale 
of our crop insurance business, lower other fees related to lower 
commercial real estate brokerage fees and the deconsolidation of 
our merchant services joint venture, and lower gains on equity 
investments and debt securities. Average loans of $454.3 billion 
in third quarter 2016 increased $48.7 billion, or 12%, from third 
quarter 2015, driven by the GE Capital business acquisitions and 
broad based growth in asset backed finance, commercial real 
estate, corporate banking, equipment finance and structured real 
estate. Average deposits of $441.2 billion in third quarter 2016 
remained flat from third quarter 2015. Noninterest expense 
increased $617 million, or 18%, from third quarter 2015 and 

17 

Earnings Performance (continued) 

$1.5 billion, or 14%, from the first nine months of 2015, due to 
higher personnel and operating lease expense related to the GE 
Capital business acquisitions as well as higher expenses related to 
growth initiatives, compliance and regulatory requirements. The 
provision for credit losses increased $121 million from third 
quarter 2015 and $1.0 billion from the first nine months of 2015 
driven by increased losses and credit deterioration in the oil and 
gas portfolio.

WIM reported net income of $677 million in third quarter 

2016, up $71 million from third quarter 2015. The increase in net 
income from third quarter 2015 was driven by higher noninterest 
income and net interest income, partially offset by higher 
noninterest expense. Net income for the first nine months of 
2016 was $1.8 billion, up $52 million, or 3%, compared with the 
same period a year ago, driven by higher net interest income and 
lower noninterest expense, primarily due to lower operating 
losses, partially offset by lower noninterest income. Revenue was 
up $221 million, or 6%, from third quarter 2015 and up $42 
million from the first nine months of 2015, driven by growth in 
net interest income and gains on deferred compensation plan 

investments (offset in employee benefits expense), partially offset 
by lower asset-based fees and lower brokerage transaction 
revenue. Net interest income increased 10% from third quarter 
2015, and was up 12% from the first nine months of 2015, due to 
growth in loan balances and investment portfolios. Average loan 
balances of $68.4 billion in third quarter 2016 increased 12% 
from third quarter 2015. Average loans in the first nine months of 
2016 increased 12% from the same period a year ago. Average 
loan growth was driven by growth in non-conforming mortgage 
loans and securities-based lending. Average deposits in third 
quarter 2016 of $189.2 billion increased 10% from third quarter 
2015. Average deposits in the first nine months of 2016 increased 

18 

9% from the same period a year ago. Noninterest expense was up 
3% from third quarter 2015, substantially driven by higher 
deferred compensation plan expense (offset in trading revenue), 
partially offset by lower operating losses, and down 1% from the 
first nine months of 2015, driven by lower operating losses and 
broker commissions, partially offset by higher deferred 
compensation plan expense (offset in trading revenue) and other 
non-personnel expenses. Provision for credit losses increased 
$10 million from third quarter 2015 and $11 million from the first 
nine months of 2015. 

The following discussions provide additional information for 
client assets we oversee in our retail brokerage advisory and trust 
and investment management business lines. 

Retail Brokerage Client Assets Brokerage advisory, 
commissions and other fees are received for providing full-service 

 
Table 4d:  Retail Brokerage Client Assets 

  

(in billions) 

Retail brokerage client assets 
Advisory account client assets 
Advisory account client assets as a percentage of total client assets 

Retail Brokerage advisory accounts include assets that are 

financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party 
managers, as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets 
where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not 
have investment discretion. These advisory accounts generate 
fees as a percentage of the market value of the assets, which vary 
across the account types based on the distinct services provided, 

Table 4e:  Retail Brokerage Advisory Account Client Assets 

  

and discount brokerage services predominantly to retail 
brokerage clients. Offering advisory account relationships to our 
brokerage clients is an important component of our broader 
strategy of meeting their financial needs. Although a majority of 
our retail brokerage client assets are in accounts that earn 
brokerage commissions, the fees from those accounts generally 
represent transactional commissions based on the number and 
size of transactions executed at the client’s direction. Fees earned 
from advisory accounts are asset-based and depend on changes in 
the value of the client’s assets as well as the level of assets 
resulting from inflows and outflows. A major portion of our 
brokerage advisory, commissions and other fee income is earned 
from advisory accounts. Table 4d shows advisory account client 
assets as a percentage of total retail brokerage client assets at 
September 30, 2016 and 2015.

and are affected by investment performance as well as asset

of 2016 and 2015, the average fee rate by account type ranged 
from 80 to 120 basis points. Table 4e presents retail brokerage

Earnings Performance (continued) 

Trust and Investment Client Assets Under Management 
 
We earn trust and investment management fees from managing 
and administering assets, including mutual funds, institutional 
separate accounts, personal trust, employee benefit trust and 
agency assets through our asset management, wealth and 
retirement businesses. Our asset management business is 
conducted by Wells Fargo Asset Management (WFAM), which 
offers Wells Fargo proprietary mutual funds and manages 
institutional separate accounts. Our wealth business manages 
assets for high net worth clients, and our retirement business 

provides total retirement management, investments, and trust 
and custody solutions tailored to meet the needs of institutional 
clients. Substantially all of our trust and investment management 
fee income is earned from AUM where we have discretionary 
management authority over the investments and generate fees as 
a percentage of the market value of the AUM. Table 4f presents 
AUM activity for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 
 
and 2015.

Balance Sheet Analysis 

At September 30, 2016, our assets totaled $1.9 trillion, up 
$154.5 billion from December 31, 2015. The predominant areas of 
asset growth were in federal funds sold and other short-term 
investments, which increased $28.2 billion, investment 
securities, which increased $43.3 billion, and loans, which 
increased $44.8 billion (including $26.5 billion from the GE 
Capital business acquisitions). Additionally, other assets 
increased $22.8 billion due to $5.9 billion in operating leases 
from the first quarter 2016 GE Capital business acquisitions, 
higher receivables related to unsettled trading security 
transactions and higher fair values for derivative assets 
designated as hedging instruments due to decreasing interest 
rates. An increase of $55.3 billion in long-term debt (including 

debt issued to fund the GE Capital business acquisitions and debt 
issued that is anticipated to be TLAC eligible), deposit growth of 
$52.6 billion, an increase in short-term borrowings of 
$27.1 billion, and total equity growth of $10.1 billion from 
December 31, 2015, were the predominant sources that funded 
our asset growth in the first nine months of 2016. Equity growth 
benefited from $9.4 billion in earnings net of dividends paid. 
The following discussion provides additional information 
about the major components of our balance sheet. Information 
regarding our capital and changes in our asset mix is included in 
the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” and “Capital 
Management” sections and Note 19 (Regulatory and Agency 
Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements in this Report.

Table 5 presents a summary of our investment securities 

portfolio, which increased $43.3 billion from December 31, 2015, 
predominantly due to purchases of federal agency mortgage-
backed securities. The increase in investment securities was 
partially offset by sales and pay-downs of federal agency 
mortgage-backed securities and sales of U.S. Treasury securities 
in our available-for-sale portfolio. 

The total net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities 

were $4.5 billion at September 30, 2016, up from $3.0 billion at 
December 31, 2015, due to a decline in interest rates. For a 
discussion of our investment management objectives and 
practices, see the "Balance Sheet Analysis" section in our 2015 
Form 10-K. Also, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management” section in this Report for information on our use of 
investments to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. 

We analyze securities for other-than-temporary impairment 
(OTTI) quarterly or more often if a potential loss-triggering event 
occurs. Of the $464 million in OTTI write-downs recognized in 
earnings in the first nine months of 2016, $142 million related to 
debt securities and $5 million related to marketable equity 
securities, which are included in available-for-sale securities. 
Another $317 million in OTTI write-downs were related to 
nonmarketable equity investments, which are included in other 
assets. OTTI write-downs recognized in earnings related to oil 
and gas investments totaled $185 million in the first nine months 
of 2016, of which $57 million related to investment securities and 
$128 million related to nonmarketable equity investments. For a 
discussion of our OTTI accounting policies and underlying 
considerations and analysis see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 

10-K and Note 4 (Investment Securities) to Financial Statements 
in this Report. 

At September 30, 2016, investment securities included 

$58.4 billion of municipal bonds, of which 96.3% were rated “A-” 
or better based largely on external and, in some cases, internal 
ratings. Additionally, some of the securities in our total municipal 
bond portfolio are guaranteed against loss by bond insurers. 
These guaranteed bonds are predominantly investment grade 
and were generally underwritten in accordance with our own 
investment standards prior to the determination to purchase, 
without relying on the bond insurer’s guarantee in making the 
investment decision. The credit quality of our municipal bond 
holdings are monitored as part of our ongoing impairment 
analysis. 

The weighted-average expected maturity of debt securities 
available-for-sale was 5.7 years at September 30, 2016. Because 
53% of this portfolio is MBS, the expected remaining maturity is 
shorter than the remaining contractual maturity because 
borrowers generally have the right to prepay obligations before 
the underlying mortgages mature. The estimated effects of a 
200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on the fair 
value and the expected remaining maturity of the MBS available-
for-sale portfolio are shown in Table 6.

$26.5 billion of commercial and industrial loans and capital 
leases acquired from GE Capital.

Equity 
Total equity was $204.0 billion at September 30, 2016, compared 
with $193.9 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase was 
predominantly driven by a $9.4 billion increase in retained 
 
earnings from earnings net of dividends paid, and a $2.4 billion 
increase in preferred stock, partially offset by a net reduction in 
common stock due to repurchases. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value 
disclosures. See our 2015 Form 10-K for a description of our 
critical accounting policy related to fair value of financial 
instruments and a discussion of our fair value measurement 
techniques. 

Table 10 presents the summary of the fair value of financial 
instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and the 
amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs (before 
derivative netting adjustments). The fair value of the remaining 
assets and liabilities were measured using valuation 
methodologies involving market-based or market-derived 
information (collectively Level 1 and 2 measurements).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial 
transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet, or may 
be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different 
from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our 
off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to lend and 
purchase securities, transactions with unconsolidated entities, 
guarantees, derivatives, and other commitments. These 
transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of 
customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/ 
or (3) diversify our funding sources. 
 
Commitments to Lend and Purchase Securities 
We enter into commitments to lend funds to customers, which 
are usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, and for specific 
purposes and time periods. When we make commitments, we are 
exposed to credit risk. However, the maximum credit risk for 
these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual 
amount because a significant portion of these commitments is 
expected to expire without being used by the customer. For more 
information on lending commitments, see Note 5 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. We also enter into commitments to purchase securities 
under resale agreements. For more information on commitments 
to purchase securities under resale agreements, see Note 3 
(Federal Funds Sold, Securities Purchased under Resale 
Agreements and Other Short-Term Investments) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 
 
Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability 
companies or partnerships that are established for a limited 
purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with 
securitization transactions and are considered variable interest 
entities (VIEs). For more information on securitizations, 
including sales proceeds and cash flows from securitizations, see 
Note 7 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Guarantees and Certain Contingent Arrangements 
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities 
lending and other indemnifications, written put options, recourse 
obligations and other types of guarantee arrangements. For more 
information on guarantees and certain contingent arrangements, 
see Note 10 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Derivatives 
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. 
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and 
volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which 
is generally not exchanged but is used only as the basis on which 
interest and other payments are determined. The notional 
amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when 
viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of 
the instruments. For more information on derivatives, see Note 
12 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

 

Other Commitments 
We also have other off-balance sheet transactions, including 
obligations to make rental payments under noncancelable 
operating leases and commitments to purchase certain debt and 
equity securities. Our operating lease obligations are discussed in 
Note 7 (Premises, Equipment, Lease Commitments and Other 
Assets) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. For more 
information on commitments to purchase debt and equity 
securities, see the “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section in 
our 2015 Form 10-K.

Risk Management 

Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly 
affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the 
expectations of our customers, stockholders, regulators and other 
stakeholders. Among the risks that we manage are operational 
risk, credit risk, and asset/liability management risk, which 
includes interest rate risk, market risk, and liquidity and funding 
risks. Our risk culture is strongly rooted in our Vision and 
Values, and in order to succeed in our mission of satisfying our 
customers’ financial needs and helping them succeed financially, 
our business practices and operating model must support 
prudent risk management practices. For more information about 
how we manage these risks, see the “Risk Management” section 
in our 2015 Form 10-K. The discussion that follows provides an 
update regarding these risks. 

Operational Risk Management 
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or 
failed internal controls and processes, people and systems, or 
resulting from external events. These losses may be caused by 
events such as fraud, breaches of customer privacy, business 
disruptions, inappropriate employee behavior, vendors that do 
not perform their responsibilities, and regulatory fines and 
penalties. 

Information security is a significant operational risk for 

financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, and includes the risk of 
losses resulting from cyber attacks. Wells Fargo and other 
financial institutions continue to be the target of various evolving 
and adaptive cyber attacks, including malware and denial-of­
service, as part of an effort to disrupt the operations of financial 
institutions, potentially test their cybersecurity capabilities, or 
obtain confidential, proprietary or other information. Cyber 
attacks have also focused on targeting the infrastructure of the 
internet, causing the widespread unavailability of websites and 
degrading website performance. Wells Fargo has not experienced 
any material losses relating to these or other cyber attacks. 
Addressing cybersecurity risks is a priority for Wells Fargo, and 
we continue to develop and enhance our controls, processes and 
systems in order to protect our networks, computers, software 
and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access. We are 
also proactively involved in industry cybersecurity efforts and 
working with other parties, including our third-party service 
providers and governmental agencies, to continue to enhance 
defenses and improve resiliency to cybersecurity threats. See the 
“Risk Factors” section in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional 
information regarding the risks associated with a failure or 
breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, 
including as a result of cyber attacks. 

Credit Risk Management 
We define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a 
borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in 
accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many 
of our assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, 
certain derivatives, and loans. The following discussion focuses 
on our loan portfolios, which represent the largest component of 
 
assets on our balance sheet for which we have credit risk. Table 11 
presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and 
class of financing receivable.

We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe 
are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while 
monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan 
portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and 
monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple 
risk factors affecting loans we hold, could acquire or originate 
including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Merger and acquisition activities 
•  Reputation risk 

Loan concentrations and related credit quality 
Counterparty credit risk 
Economic and market conditions 
Legislative or regulatory mandates 
Changes in interest rates 

Our credit risk management oversight process is governed 

centrally, but provides for decentralized management and 
accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process 
includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit 
underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and 
modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual 
loan review and audit process. 

A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-

controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate 
for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase 
the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

PURCHASED CREDIT-IMPAIRED (PCI) LOANS  Loans 
acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since their 
origination and where it is probable that we will not collect all 
contractually required principal and interest payments are PCI 
loans. Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired in the 
Wachovia acquisition on December 31, 2008. PCI loans are 
recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, and the historical 
allowance for credit losses related to these loans is not carried 
over. The carrying value of PCI loans at September 30, 2016, 
which included $290 million from the GE Capital business 
acquisitions, totaled $17.7 billion, compared with $20.0 billion at 
December 31, 2015, and $58.8 billion at December 31, 2008. The 
decrease from December 31, 2015, was due in part to higher 
prepayment trends observed in our Pick-a-Pay PCI portfolio. PCI 
loans are considered to be accruing due to the existence of the 
accretable yield amount, which represents the cash expected to be 
collected in excess of their carrying value, and not based on 
consideration given to contractual interest payments. The 
accretable yield at September 30, 2016, was $11.6 billion. 

A nonaccretable difference is established for PCI loans to 

absorb losses expected on the contractual amounts of those loans 
in excess of the fair value recorded at the date of acquisition. 
Amounts absorbed by the nonaccretable difference do not affect 
the income statement or the allowance for credit losses. Since 
December 31, 2008, we have released $12.9 billion in 
nonaccretable difference, including $11.0 billion transferred from 
the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield due to 
decreases in our initial estimate of loss on contractual amounts, 
and $1.9 billion released to income through loan resolutions. 
Also, we have provided $1.7 billion for losses on certain PCI loans 
or pools of PCI loans that have had credit-related decreases to 
cash flows expected to be collected. The net result is an 
$11.2 billion reduction from December 31, 2008, through 
September 30, 2016, in our initial projected losses of 
$41.0 billion on all PCI loans acquired in the Wachovia 
acquisition. At September 30, 2016, $936 million in 
nonaccretable difference, which included $116 million from the 
GE Capital business acquisitions, remained to absorb losses on 
PCI loans.

 For additional information on PCI loans, see the "Risk 

Management – Credit Risk Management – Real Estate 1-4 Family 
First and Junior Lien Mortgage Loans – Pick-a-Pay Portfolio" 
section in this Report, Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 
10-K, and Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

  

Credit Quality Overview  Credit quality remained solid in 
third quarter 2016 as our loss rate remained low at 0.33%. We 
continued to benefit from improvements in the performance of 
our residential real estate portfolio, which was partially offset by 
losses in our oil and gas portfolio. In particular: 
• 	 Nonaccrual loans were $11.0 billion at September 30, 2016, 

down from $11.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Although 
commercial nonaccrual loans increased to $4.3 billion at 
September 30, 2016, compared with $2.4 billion at 
December 31, 2015, consumer nonaccrual loans declined to 
$6.7 billion at September 30, 2016, compared with 
$9.0 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase in 
commercial nonaccrual loans, predominantly driven by loans 
in our oil and gas portfolio, partially offset the decline in 
consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting an improved housing 
market. Nonaccrual loans represented 1.14% of total loans at 
September 30, 2016, compared with 1.24% at December 31, 
2015. 

 

 

• 	 Net charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of average total 
loans increased to 0.33% and 0.37% in the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2016, respectively, compared with 0.31% 
 
in both periods a year ago. Net charge-offs (annualized) as a 
percentage of our average commercial and consumer 
portfolios were 0.17% and 0.51% in third quarter and 0.22% 
 
and 0.52% in the first nine months of 2016, respectively, 
compared with 0.08% and 0.53% in the third quarter and 
0.06% and 0.55% in the first nine months of 2015. 
Loans that are not government insured/guaranteed and 
90 days or more past due and still accruing were $51 million 
 
and $802 million in our commercial and consumer 
portfolios, respectively, at September 30, 2016, compared 
with $114 million and $867 million at December 31, 2015. 

• 	

• 	 Our provision for credit losses was $805 million and 

$3.0 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, respectively, compared with $703 million and 
$1.6 billion, for the same periods a year ago. 
 
The allowance for credit losses totaled $12.7 billion, or 1.32% 
of total loans, at September 30, 2016, up from $12.5 billion, 
or 1.37%, at December 31, 2015.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews  Measuring and 
monitoring our credit risk is an ongoing process that tracks 
delinquencies, collateral values, FICO scores, economic trends by 
geographic areas, loan-level risk grading for certain portfolios 
(typically commercial) and other indications of credit risk. Our 
credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early 
identification of developing risk and to support our 
determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The 
following discussion provides additional characteristics and 
analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each 
of the following portfolios. 

  

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE 
FINANCING  For purposes of portfolio risk management, we 
aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 
according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. 
We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing to individual risk assessment using our internal 
borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized divided between special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. 

The commercial and industrial loans and lease financing 

portfolio totaled $342.9 billion, or 36% of total loans, at 
September 30, 2016. The annualized net charge-off rate for this 
portfolio was 0.30% and 0.36% in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, respectively, compared with 0.17% and 0.13% for 
the same periods a year ago. At September 30, 2016, 1.00% of 
this portfolio was nonaccruing, compared with 0.44% at 
December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.0 billion. Also, $23.7 billion 
 
of this portfolio was internally classified as criticized in 
accordance with regulatory guidance at September 30, 2016, 
compared with $19.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase 
in criticized loans, which also includes the increase in nonaccrual 
loans, was primarily due to the initial classification of loans and 
capital leases acquired from GE Capital, and to deterioration in 
the oil and gas portfolio. Based on additional refinement of our 
initial classification of the criticized loans and leases acquired 
from GE Capital, we continued to see classification improvement. 

Most of our commercial and industrial loans and lease 
financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as 
accounts receivable, inventory and securities, as well as long-
lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. 
Generally, the collateral securing this portfolio represents a 
secondary source of repayment. 

Table 12 provides a breakout of commercial and industrial 

 
loans and lease financing by industry, and includes $52.5 billion 
of foreign loans at September 30, 2016. Foreign loans totaled 
$14.2 billion within the investor category, $16.6 billion within the 
financial institutions category and $2.1 billion within the oil and 
gas category. 

The investors category includes loans to special purpose 

vehicles (SPVs) formed by sponsoring entities to invest in 
financial assets backed predominantly by commercial and 
residential real estate or corporate cash flow, and are repaid from 
the asset cash flows or the sale of assets by the SPV. We limit loan 
amounts to a percentage of the value of the underlying assets, as 
determined by us, based on analysis of underlying credit risk and 
other factors such as asset duration and ongoing performance. 

We provide financial institutions with a variety of 

relationship focused products and services, including loans 
supporting short-term trade finance and working capital needs. 
The $16.6 billion of foreign loans in the financial institutions 
category were predominantly originated by our Global Financial 
Institutions (GFI) business. 

The oil and gas loan portfolio totaled $16.0 billion, or 2% of 

total outstanding loans at September 30, 2016, compared with 
$17.4 billion, or 2% of total outstanding loans, at December 31, 
2015. Unfunded loan commitments in the oil and gas loan 
portfolio totaled $22.3 billion at September 30, 2016. 
Approximately half of our oil and gas loans were to businesses in 
the exploration and production (E&P) sector. Most of these E&P 
loans are secured by oil and/or gas reserves and have underlying 
borrowing base arrangements which include regular (typically 
semi-annual) “redeterminations” that consider refinements to 
borrowing structure and prices used to determine borrowing 
limits. The majority of the other oil and gas loans were to 
midstream companies. We proactively monitor our oil and gas 
loan portfolio and work with customers to address any emerging 
issues. Oil and gas nonaccrual loans increased to $2.5 billion at 
September 30, 2016, compared with $844 million at 
December 31, 2015, due to weaker borrower financial 
performance.

Risk Management - Credit Risk Management (continued) 

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE)  We generally subject CRE 
loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower 
and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to 
regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with 
criticized divided between special mention, substandard, 
doubtful and loss categories. The CRE portfolio, which included 
$8.8 billion of foreign CRE loans, totaled $153.6 billion, or 16% of 
total loans, at September 30, 2016, and consisted of 
$130.2 billion of mortgage loans and $23.4 billion of construction 
loans. 

Table 13 summarizes CRE loans by state and property type 

with the related nonaccrual totals. The portfolio is diversified 
both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic 
concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Texas 

 
Table 13:  CRE Loans by State and Property Type 

  

and Florida, which combined represented 49% of the total CRE 
portfolio. By property type, the largest concentrations are office 
buildings at 28% and apartments at 16% of the portfolio. CRE 
nonaccrual loans totaled 0.5% of the CRE outstanding balance at 
September 30, 2016, compared with 0.7% at December 31, 
2015. At September 30, 2016, we had $5.6 billion of criticized 
CRE mortgage loans, compared with $6.8 billion at December 31, 
2015, and $562 million of criticized CRE construction loans, 
compared with $549 million at December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, the recorded investment in PCI CRE 

loans totaled $470 million, down from $12.3 billion when 
acquired at December 31, 2008, reflecting principal payments, 
loan resolutions and write-downs.

We conduct periodic stress tests of our significant country 
risk exposures, analyzing the direct and indirect impacts on the 
risk of loss from various macroeconomic and capital markets 
scenarios. We do not have significant exposure to foreign country 
risks because our foreign portfolio is relatively small. However, 
we have identified exposure to increased loss from U.S. 
borrowers associated with the potential impact of a regional or 
worldwide economic downturn on the U.S. economy. We mitigate 
these potential impacts on the risk of loss through our normal 
risk management processes which include active monitoring and, 
if necessary, the application of aggressive loss mitigation 
strategies. 

Table 14 provides information regarding our top 

20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) and our Eurozone 
exposure, on an ultimate risk basis. Our exposure to Puerto Rico 
(considered part of U.S. exposure) is largely through automobile 
lending and was not material to our consolidated country risk 
exposure. 

FOREIGN LOANS AND COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE  We 
classify loans for financial statement and certain regulatory 
purposes as foreign primarily based on whether the borrower’s 
primary address is outside of the United States. At September 30, 
2016, foreign loans totaled $61.7 billion, representing 
approximately 6% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, 
compared with $58.6 billion, or approximately 6% of total 
consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2015. Foreign 
loans were approximately 3% of our consolidated total assets at 
September 30, 2016 and at December 31, 2015. 

Our foreign country risk monitoring process incorporates 

frequent dialogue with our financial institution customers, 
counterparties and regulatory agencies, enhanced by centralized 
monitoring of macroeconomic and capital markets conditions in 
the respective countries. We establish exposure limits for each 
country through a centralized oversight process based on 
customer needs, and in consideration of relevant economic, 
political, social, legal, and transfer risks. We monitor exposures 
closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing 
conditions. 

We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on 
our assessment of ultimate risk, which is normally based on the 
country of residence of the guarantor or collateral location, and 
may be different from the reporting based on the borrower’s 
primary address. Our largest single foreign country exposure on 
an ultimate risk basis at September 30, 2016, was the United 
Kingdom, which totaled $26.9 billion, or approximately 1% of our 
total assets, and included $3.5 billion of sovereign claims. Our 
United Kingdom sovereign claims arise predominantly from 
deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to 
regulatory requirements in support of our London branch. 
Britain's vote to withdraw from the European Union (Brexit) in 
June 2016 did not have a material impact on our United 
Kingdom or other foreign exposure as of September 30, 2016. As 
the United Kingdom prepares for the negotiations on the terms of 
its exit from the European Union, we will be reviewing our 
capabilities in the region and plan to make any adjustments 
necessary and prudent for serving our customers. Our exposure 
to Canada, our second largest foreign country exposure on an 
ultimate risk basis, totaled $17.7 billion at September 30, 2016, 
up $2.6 billion from December 31, 2015, predominantly due to 
the GE Capital business acquisitions.

(1) 	 Lending exposure includes funded loans and unfunded commitments, leveraged leases, and money market placements presented on a gross basis prior to the deduction of 
impairment allowance and collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements. For the countries listed above, includes $16 million in PCI loans, predominantly to 
customers in Germany and the Netherlands, and $947 million in defeased leases secured primarily by U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, or government 
guaranteed. 

(2) 	 Represents exposure on debt and equity securities of foreign issuers. Long and short positions are netted and net short positions are reflected as negative exposure. 
(3) 	 Represents counterparty exposure on foreign exchange and derivative contracts, and securities resale and lending agreements. This exposure is presented net of 

counterparty netting adjustments and reduced by the amount of cash collateral. It includes credit default swaps (CDS) predominantly used to manage our U.S. and 
London-based cash credit trading businesses, which sometimes results in selling and purchasing protection on the identical reference entity. Generally, we do not use 
market instruments such as CDS to hedge the credit risk of our investment or loan positions, although we do use them to manage risk in our trading businesses. At 
September 30, 2016, the gross notional amount of our CDS sold that reference assets in the Top 20 or Eurozone countries was $2.3 billion, which was offset by the notional 
amount of CDS purchased of $2.5 billion. We did not have any CDS purchased or sold that reference pools of assets that contain sovereign debt or where the reference 
asset was solely the sovereign debt of a foreign country. 

(4) 	 For countries presented in the table, total non-sovereign exposure comprises $37.7 billion exposure to financial institutions and $42.2 billion to non-financial corporations 

at September 30, 2016. 

(5) 	 Consists of exposure to Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, France and Luxembourg included in Top 20. 
(6) 	

Includes non-sovereign exposure to Italy and Portugal in the amount of $114 million and $22 million, respectively, and no non-sovereign exposure in Greece. We had no 
sovereign debt exposure to Italy and Greece, and the exposure to Portugal was immaterial at September 30, 2016.

REAL ESTATE 1-4 FAMILY FIRST AND JUNIOR LIEN 
MORTGAGE LOANS  Our real estate 1-4 family first and junior 
lien mortgage loans, as presented in Table 15, include loans we 
have made to customers and retained as part of our asset/liability 
management strategy, the Pick-a-Pay portfolio acquired from 

 

Wachovia which is discussed later in this Report and other 
purchased loans, and loans included on our balance sheet as a 
result of consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs).

Total real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 

The real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio includes 

some loans with adjustable-rate features and some with an 
interest-only feature as part of the loan terms. Interest-only loans 
were approximately 7% and 9% of total loans at September 30, 
2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. We believe we have 
manageable adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) reset risk across 
our owned mortgage loan portfolios. We do not offer option ARM 
products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with 
fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the 
financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans. 
The option ARMs we do have are included in the Pick-a-Pay 
portfolio which was acquired from Wachovia. Since our 
acquisition of the Pick-a-Pay loan portfolio at the end of 2008, 
the option payment portion of the portfolio has reduced from 
86% to 37% at September 30, 2016, as a result of our 
modification activities and customers exercising their option to 
convert to fixed payments. For more information, see the “Pick-a-
Pay Portfolio” section in this Report. 

We continue to modify real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial 
difficulties. For more information on our participation in the U.S. 
Treasury’s Making Home Affordable (MHA) programs, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Real Estate 1-4 
Family First and Junior Lien Mortgage Loans” section in our 
2015 Form 10-K. 

Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, 
current FICO scores and loan/combined loan to collateral values 
(LTV/CLTV) on the entire real estate 1-4 family mortgage loan 
portfolio. These credit risk indicators, which exclude government 
insured/guaranteed loans, continued to improve in third quarter 
2016 on the non-PCI mortgage portfolio. Loans 30 days or more 
delinquent at September 30, 2016, totaled $6.0 billion, or 2% of 
total non-PCI mortgages, compared with $8.3 billion, or 3%, at 
December 31, 2015. Loans with FICO scores lower than 640 
totaled $17.6 billion, or 6% of total non-PCI mortgages at 
September 30, 2016, compared with $21.1 billion, or 7%, at 
December 31, 2015. Mortgages with a LTV/CLTV greater than 
100% totaled $10.5 billion at September 30, 2016, or 3% of total 
non-PCI mortgages, compared with $15.1 billion, or 5%, at 
December 31, 2015. Information regarding credit quality 
indicators, including PCI credit quality indicators, can be found 
in Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report. 

Real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans by 

state are presented in Table 16. Our real estate 1-4 family 
mortgage loans (including PCI loans) to borrowers in California 
represented approximately 12% of total loans at September 30, 
2016, located mostly within the larger metropolitan areas, with 
 
no single California metropolitan area consisting of more than 5% 
of total loans. We monitor changes in real estate values and

First Lien Mortgage Portfolio  Our total real estate 1-4 family 
first lien mortgage portfolio increased $1.5 billion in third quarter 
2016 and $4.8 billion in the first nine months of 2016, as we 
retained $15.9 billion and $43.9 billion in non-conforming 
originations, consisting of loans that exceed conventional 
conforming loan amount limits established by federal 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs), in the third quarter and 
first nine months of 2016, respectively. 

The credit performance associated with our real estate 1-4 

family first lien mortgage portfolio continued to improve in third 
quarter 2016, as measured through net charge-offs and 
nonaccrual loans. Net charge-offs (annualized) as a percentage of 
average real estate 1-4 family first lien mortgage loans improved 

to 0.03% and 0.04% in the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, respectively, compared with 0.09% and 0.11% for the same 
periods a year ago. Nonaccrual loans were $5.3 billion at 
September 30, 2016, compared with $7.3 billion at December 31, 
2015. Improvement in the credit performance was driven by an 
improving housing environment. Real estate 1-4 family first lien 
mortgage loans originated after 2008, which generally utilized 
tighter underwriting standards, have resulted in minimal losses 
to date and were approximately 72% of our total real estate 1-4 
family first lien mortgage portfolio as of September 30, 2016.

the first lien mortgage portfolio and lists the top five states by

Pick-a-Pay Portfolio  The Pick-a-Pay portfolio was one of the 
consumer residential first lien mortgage portfolios we acquired 
from Wachovia and a majority of the portfolio was identified as 
PCI loans. 

The Pick-a-Pay portfolio includes loans that offer payment 

options (Pick-a-Pay option payment loans), and also includes 
loans that were originated without the option payment feature, 
loans that no longer offer the option feature as a result of our 
modification efforts since the acquisition, and loans where the 
customer voluntarily converted to a fixed-rate product. The Pick­
a-Pay portfolio is included in the consumer real estate 1-4 family

first mortgage class of loans throughout this Report. Table 18 
 
provides balances by types of loans as of September 30, 2016, as a 
result of modification efforts, compared to the types of loans 
included in the portfolio at acquisition. Total adjusted unpaid 
principal balance of PCI Pick-a-Pay loans was $21.4 billion at 
September 30, 2016, compared with $61.0 billion at acquisition. 
Due to loan modification and loss mitigation efforts, the adjusted 
unpaid principal balance of option payment PCI loans has 
declined to 14% of the total Pick-a-Pay portfolio at September 30, 
2016, compared with 51% at acquisition.

Table 19 reflects the geographic distribution of the Pick-a-
Pay portfolio broken out between PCI loans and all other loans. 
The LTV ratio is a useful metric in evaluating future real estate 
1-4 family first mortgage loan performance, including potential 
charge-offs. Because PCI loans were initially recorded at fair 
value, including write-downs for expected credit losses, the ratio 

 
Table 19:  Pick-a-Pay Portfolio (1) 

  

of the carrying value to the current collateral value will be lower 
compared with the LTV based on the adjusted unpaid principal 
balance. For informational purposes, we have included both 
ratios for PCI loans in the following table.

stress exist that indicate there will be a loss of contractually due amounts upon final resolution of the loan. 

(3) 	 The current LTV ratio is calculated as the adjusted unpaid principal balance divided by the collateral value. Collateral values are generally determined using automated 

valuation models (AVM) and are updated quarterly. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate market values of homes based on processing large volumes of market 
data including market comparables and price trends for local market areas. 

(4) 	 Carrying value does not reflect related allowance for loan losses but does reflect remaining purchase accounting adjustments and any charge-offs. 
(5) 	 The ratio of carrying value to current value is calculated as the carrying value divided by the collateral value. 

Since the Wachovia acquisition, we have completed over 

135,000 proprietary and Home Affordability Modification 
Program (HAMP) Pick-a-Pay loan modifications, including over 
900 modifications in third quarter 2016. Pick-a-Pay loan 
modifications have resulted in over $6.1 billion of principal 
forgiveness. We have also provided interest rate reductions and 
loan term extensions of up to 40 years to enable sustainable 
homeownership for our Pick-a-Pay customers. As a result of these 
loss mitigation programs, approximately 70% of our Pick-a-Pay 
 
PCI adjusted unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2016 
has been modified. 

The predominant portion of our PCI loans is included in the 
Pick-a-Pay portfolio. We regularly evaluate our estimates, of cash 
flows expected to be collected on our PCI loans. Our cash flows 
expected to be collected have been favorably affected over time by 
lower expected defaults and losses as a result of observed and 
forecasted economic strengthening, particularly in housing 
prices, and our loan modification efforts. When we periodically 
update our cash flow estimates we have historically expected that 
the credit-stressed borrower characteristics and distressed 
collateral values associated with our Pick-a-Pay PCI loans would 
limit the ability of these borrowers to prepay their loans, thus 
increasing the future expected weighted-average life of the 
portfolio since acquisition. However, over the last several 
quarters we have observed a higher prepayment trend emerging 
in our Pick-a-Pay PCI loans portfolio. We attribute this favorable 
prepayment experience to the benefits of home price appreciation 
which has resulted in loan (unpaid principal balance) to value 
ratios reaching an important industry refinancing inflection point 
of below 80%. As a result, we have experienced an increased level 
of borrowers qualifying for products to refinance their loans 
which may not have previously been available to them. Therefore, 
for third quarter 2016, we revised our Pick-a-Pay PCI loan cash 
flow estimates to reflect our expectation that the modified 
portion of the portfolio will have significantly higher 

prepayments over the remainder of its life. The recent reductions 
in loan to value ratios and projections of sustained higher 
housing prices have reduced our loss estimates for this portfolio. 
The significant increase in expected prepayments lowered our 
estimated weighted-average life to approximately 7.6 years at 
September 30, 2016, from 11.5 years at June 30, 2016. Also, our 
revised cash flow estimates resulted in a $4.1 billion reduction in 
the accretable yield balance as of September 30, 2016, driven by a 
$4.9 billion reduction in expected cash flows resulting from the 
shorter estimated weighted-average life, partially offset by a 
transfer of $1.2 billion from nonaccretable difference to 
accretable yield due to the reduction in expected losses. Because 
the $1.2 billion transfer from nonaccretable difference to 
accretable yield resulted in a high amount of accretable yield 
relative to the shortened estimated weighted-average life, we 
expect the accretable yield percentage to be 8.22% for fourth 
quarter 2016, up from 6.68% at September 30, 2016. 

Since acquisition, due to better than expected performance 

observed on the PCI portion of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio compared 
with the original acquisition estimates, we have reclassified 
$8.3 billion from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable 
yield. Fluctuations in the accretable yield are driven by changes in 
interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans, prepayment 
assumptions, and expected principal and interest payments over 
the estimated life of the portfolio, which will be affected by the 
pace and degree of improvements in the U.S. economy and 
housing markets and projected lifetime performance resulting 
from loan modification activity. Changes in the projected timing 
of cash flow events, including loan liquidations, modifications 
and short sales, can also affect the accretable yield and the 
estimated weighted-average life of the portfolio. 

For further information on the judgment involved in 

estimating expected cash flows for PCI loans, see the “Critical 
Accounting Policies – Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans” section

Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio  The junior lien mortgage 
portfolio consists of residential mortgage lines and loans that are 
subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. It 
is not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods, 
interest only payments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and 
similar features. Substantially all of our junior lien loan products 
are amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and 
repayment periods between five to 30 years. 

We continuously monitor the credit performance of our 

junior lien mortgage portfolio for trends and factors that 
influence the frequency and severity of loss. We have observed 
that the severity of loss for junior lien mortgages is high and 
generally not affected by whether we or a third party own or 
service the related first lien mortgage, but the frequency of 
delinquency is typically lower when we own or service the first 
lien mortgage. In general, we have limited information available 
on the delinquency status of the third party owned or serviced 

 
Table 20:  Junior Lien Mortgage Portfolio Performance 

  

Table 20 shows certain delinquency and loss information for 

senior lien where we also hold a junior lien. To capture this 
inherent loss content, our allowance process for junior lien 
mortgages considers the relative difference in loss experience for 
junior lien mortgages behind first lien mortgage loans we own or 
service, compared with those behind first lien mortgage loans 
owned or serviced by third parties. In addition, our allowance 
process for junior lien mortgages that are current, but are in their 
revolving period, considers the inherent loss where the borrower 
is delinquent on the corresponding first lien mortgage loans. 
 
the junior lien mortgage portfolio and lists the top five states by 
outstanding balance. The decrease in outstanding balances since 
December 31, 2015, predominantly reflects loan paydowns. As of 
September 30, 2016, 13% of the outstanding balance of the junior 
lien mortgage portfolio was associated with loans that had a 
combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio in excess of 100%. Of those 
junior lien mortgages with a CLTV ratio in excess of 100%, 2.64% 
 
were 30 days or more past due. CLTV means the ratio of the total 
loan balance of first lien mortgages and junior lien mortgages 
(including unused line amounts for credit line products) to 
property collateral value. The unsecured portion (the outstanding 
amount that was in excess of the most recent property collateral 
value) of the outstanding balances of these loans totaled 5% of 
the junior lien mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2016.

Our junior lien, as well as first lien, lines of credit portfolios 

generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with variable 
interest rate and payment options during the draw period of (1) 
interest only or (2) 1.5% of outstanding principal balance plus 
accrued interest. During the draw period, the borrower has the 
option of converting all or a portion of the line from a variable 
interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only 
payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a 
fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to 30 
years. At the end of the draw period, a line of credit generally 
converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment 
terms of up to 30 years based on the balance at time of 
conversion. Certain lines and loans have been structured with a 
balloon payment, which requires full repayment of the 
outstanding balance at the end of the term period. The 
conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff 
may result in a significant payment increase, which can affect 
some borrowers’ ability to repay the outstanding balance. 

On a monthly basis, we monitor the payment characteristics 

of borrowers in our junior lien portfolio. In September 2016, 
approximately 48% of these borrowers paid only the minimum 
amount due and approximately 46% paid more than the 
minimum amount due. The rest were either delinquent or paid 
less than the minimum amount due. For the borrowers with an 
interest only payment feature, approximately 35% paid only the 

 

minimum amount due and approximately 60% paid more than 
the minimum amount due. 

The lines that enter their amortization period may 

experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the 
ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this 
increased inherent risk in our allowance for credit loss estimate. 

In anticipation of our borrowers reaching the end of their 

contractual commitment, we have created a program to inform, 
educate and help these borrowers transition from interest-only to 
fully-amortizing payments or full repayment. We monitor the 
performance of the borrowers moving through the program in an 
effort to refine our ongoing program strategy. 

Table 21 reflects the outstanding balance of our portfolio of 
junior lien mortgages, including lines and loans, and senior lien 
lines segregated into scheduled end of draw or end of term 
periods and products that are currently amortizing, or in balloon 
repayment status. It excludes real estate 1-4 family first lien line 
reverse mortgages, which total $2.0 billion, because they are 
predominantly insured by the FHA, and it excludes PCI loans, 
which total $67 million, because their losses were generally 
reflected in our nonaccretable difference established at the date 
of acquisition.

billion to $8.1 billion and averaging $6.1 billion per year. 
Junior and first lien lines are mostly interest-only during their draw period. The unfunded credit commitments for junior and first lien lines totaled $66.6 billion at 
September 30, 2016. 
Includes scheduled end-of-term balloon payments for lines and loans totaling $31 million, $281 million, $359 million, $346 million, $373 million and $963 million for 2016 
 
2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 and thereafter, respectively. Amortizing lines and loans include $133 million of end-of-term balloon payments, which are past due. At 
September 30, 2016, $503 million, or 4% of outstanding lines of credit that are amortizing, are 30 days or more past due compared to $737 million or 2% for lines in their 
draw period. 

CREDIT CARDS  Our credit card portfolio totaled $35.0 billion at 
September 30, 2016, which represented 4% of our total 
outstanding loans. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our 
credit card portfolio was 2.82% for third quarter 2016, compared 
with 2.71% for third quarter 2015 and 3.07% and 3.03% for the 
first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
AUTOMOBILE  Our automobile portfolio, predominantly 
composed of indirect loans, totaled $62.9 billion at 
September 30, 2016. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for our 
automobile portfolio was 0.87% for third quarter 2016, compared 
with 0.76% for third quarter 2015 and 0.77% and 0.66% for the 
first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 
net charge-offs in 2016 as compared with 2015 was consistent 
with trends in the automobile lending industry. 

 

 

OTHER REVOLVING CREDIT AND INSTALLMENT  Other 
revolving credit and installment loans totaled $40.2 billion at 
September 30, 2016, and primarily included student and 
security-based loans. Student loans totaled $12.5 billion at 
September 30, 2016. The net charge-off rate (annualized) for 
other revolving credit and installment loans was 1.40% for third 
quarter 2016, compared with 1.35% for third quarter 2015 and 
1.38% and 1.31% for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.

NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND 
FORECLOSED ASSETS)  Table 22 summarizes nonperforming 
assets (NPAs) for each of the last four quarters. Total NPAs 
decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter 2016 to $12.0 billion 
 
with improvement across our consumer and commercial 
portfolios. Nonaccrual loans decreased $977 million from second 
quarter to $11.0 billion led by a $732 million decrease in 
consumer nonaccruals, which included the sale of nonaccrual 
loans during third quarter 2016. Foreclosed assets of $1.0 billion 
were down $97 million from second quarter 2016. 

We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when: 
• 	

the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes 
uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the 
borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, 
if any); 

• 	

• 	
• 	

• 	

they are 90 days (120 days with respect to real estate 1-4 
family first and junior lien mortgages) past due for interest 
or principal, unless both well-secured and in the process of 
collection; 
part of the principal balance has been charged off; 
for junior lien mortgages, we have evidence that the related 
first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in the 
process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien 
delinquency status; or 
consumer real estate and automobile loans are discharged in 
bankruptcy, regardless of their delinquency status.

Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period 
represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status 
in accordance with our policy, offset by reductions for loans that 
are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer 
classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and 
an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan 
repayment capabilities. Also, reductions can come from borrower 
repayments even if the loan remains on nonaccrual. 

• 	

• 	

timely collection of interest or principal had become 
uncertain. 
the risk of loss of all nonaccrual loans has been considered 
and we believe is adequately covered by the allowance for 
loan losses. 
$1.7 billion of consumer loans discharged in bankruptcy and 
classified as nonaccrual were 60 days or less past due, of 
which $1.6 billion were current. 

While nonaccrual loans are not free of loss content, we believe 
exposure to loss is significantly mitigated by the following factors 
at September 30, 2016: 
• 	

94% of total commercial nonaccrual loans and over 99% of 
total consumer nonaccrual loans are secured. Of the 
consumer nonaccrual loans, 98% are secured by real estate 
and 78% have a combined LTV (CLTV) ratio of 80% or less. 
losses of $463 million and $2.3 billion have already been 
 
recognized on 13% of commercial nonaccrual loans and 48% 
of consumer nonaccrual loans, respectively. Generally, when 
a consumer real estate loan is 120 days past due (except 
when required earlier by guidance issued by bank regulatory 
agencies), we transfer it to nonaccrual status. When the loan 
reaches 180 days past due, or is discharged in bankruptcy, it 
is our policy to write these loans down to net realizable value 
(fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell), except for 
modifications in their trial period that are not written down 
as long as trial payments are made on time. Thereafter, we 
reevaluate each loan regularly and record additional write-
downs if needed. 
88% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on 
interest, but were on nonaccrual status because the full or

We continue to work with our customers experiencing 

financial difficulty to determine if they can qualify for a loan 
modification so that they can stay in their homes. Under both our 
proprietary modification programs and the MHA programs, 
customers may be required to provide updated documentation, 
and some programs require completion of payment during trial 
periods to demonstrate sustained performance before the loan 
can be removed from nonaccrual status.

(1) 	 Foreclosed government insured/guaranteed loans are temporarily transferred to and held by us as servicer, until reimbursement is received from FHA or VA. The net change 

in government insured/guaranteed foreclosed assets is made up of inflows from mortgages held for investment and MHFS, and outflows when we are reimbursed by FHA/ 
VA. Transfers from government insured/guaranteed loans to foreclosed assets amounted to $110 million, $45 million, $61 million, $46 million and $38 million for the 
quarters ended September 30, June 30 and March 31, 2016, and December 31 and September 30, 2015, respectively. 

(2) 	 Predominantly include loans moved into foreclosure from nonaccrual status, PCI loans transitioned directly to foreclosed assets and repossessed automobiles. 

Foreclosed assets at September 30, 2016, included 

$604 million of foreclosed residential real estate, of which 47% is 
predominantly FHA insured or VA guaranteed and expected to 
have minimal or no loss content. The remaining foreclosed assets 
balance of $416 million has been written down to estimated net 
 
realizable value. Foreclosed assets at September 30, 2016 
 
decreased compared with December 31, 2015. Of the $1.0 billion 
in foreclosed assets at September 30, 2016, 53% have been in the 
foreclosed assets portfolio one year or less.

(1)  TDR loans include $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.8 billion at September 30, June 30, and March 31, 2016, and December 31, and September 30, 
 

 

2015, respectively, of government insured/guaranteed loans that are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA and accruing. 

 

Table 25 provides information regarding the recorded 

investment of loans modified in TDRs. The allowance for loan 
losses for TDRs was $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion at 
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. See 
Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial 
Statements in this Report for additional information regarding 
TDRs. In those situations where principal is forgiven, the entire 
amount of such forgiveness is immediately charged off to the 
extent not done so prior to the modification. We sometimes delay 
the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal (principal 
forbearance) and charge off the amount of forbearance if that 
amount is not considered fully collectible. 

For more information on our nonaccrual policies when a 
restructuring is involved, see the "Risk Management – Credit 
Risk Management – Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)" 
section in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Table 26 provides an analysis of the changes in TDRs. Loans 
modified more than once are reported as TDR inflows only in the 
period they are first modified. Other than resolutions such as 
foreclosures, sales and transfers to held for sale, we may remove 
loans held for investment from TDR classification, but only if 
they have been refinanced or restructured at market terms and 
qualify as a new loan.

Inflows include loans that both modify and resolve within the period as well as advances on loans that modified in a prior period. 

(1) 	
(2) 	 Other outflows include normal amortization/accretion of loan basis adjustments and loans transferred to held-for-sale. It also includes $6 million of loans refinanced or 
restructured at market terms and qualifying as new loans and removed from TDR classification for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, while no loans were removed 
from TDR classification for the quarters ended September 30, June 30, and March 31, 2016, and September 30, 2015. 

(3) 	 Net change in trial modifications includes: inflows of new TDRs entering the trial payment period, net of outflows for modifications that either (i) successfully perform and 

enter into a permanent modification, or (ii) did not successfully perform according to the terms of the trial period plan and are subsequently charged-off, foreclosed upon or 
otherwise resolved. Our experience is that substantially all of the mortgages that enter a trial payment period program are successful in completing the program 
requirements.

LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING 
Loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal are still 
accruing if they are (1) well-secured and in the process of 
collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans or 
consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being 
classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days 
past due. PCI loans are not included in past due and still accruing 
loans even though they are 90 days or more contractually past 
due. These PCI loans are considered to be accruing because they 
continue to earn interest from accretable yield, independent of 
performance in accordance with their contractual terms. 

Excluding insured/guaranteed loans, loans 90 days or more 

past due and still accruing at September 30, 2016, were down 
$128 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2015, due to payoffs, 
modifications and other loss mitigation activities and credit

stabilization. Also, fluctuations from quarter to quarter are 
influenced by seasonality. 

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing whose 

repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA for mortgages and the U.S. Department of Education 
for student loans under the Federal Family Education Loan 
Program (FFELP) were $11.2 billion at September 30, 2016, 
down from $13.4 billion at December 31, 2015, due to seasonally 
lower delinquencies. 

Table 27 reflects non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due 
and still accruing by class for loans not government insured/ 
guaranteed. For additional information on delinquencies by loan 
class, see Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to

(1)  Quarterly net charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average respective loans are annualized. 

Table 28 presents net charge-offs for third quarter 2016 and 
 
the previous four quarters. Net charge-offs in third quarter 2016 
were $805 million (0.33% of average total loans outstanding) 
compared with $703 million (0.31%) in third quarter 2015. 

The increase in commercial and industrial net charge-offs 

from third quarter 2015 reflected higher oil and gas portfolio 
losses. Our commercial real estate portfolios were in a net 
recovery position. Total consumer net charge-offs decreased 
slightly from the prior year. 

 

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The allowance for credit 
losses, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the 
allowance for unfunded credit commitments, is management’s 
estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and 
unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date, 
excluding loans carried at fair value. The detail of the changes in 
the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment (including 
charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is in Note 5 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 

We apply a disciplined process and methodology to establish 

our allowance for credit losses each quarter. This process takes 
into consideration many factors, including historical and 
forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan 
grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and 
complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit 
metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do 
not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use 
several analytical tools. Our estimation approach for the 
commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default 
in accordance with the borrower’s financial strength, and the 
severity of loss in the event of default, considering the quality of 
any underlying collateral. Probability of default and severity at 
the time of default are statistically derived through historical 
observations of defaults and losses after default within each 
credit risk rating. Our estimation approach for the consumer 
portfolio uses forecasted losses that represent our best estimate 
of inherent loss based on historical experience, quantitative and 
other mathematical techniques. For additional information on 
our allowance for credit losses, see the “Critical Accounting 
Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section in our 2015 Form 
10-K and Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

Table 29 presents the allocation of the allowance for credit 

losses by loan segment and class for the most recent quarter end 
and last four year ends.

(1)  Total net charge-offs are annualized for quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

In addition to the allowance for credit losses, there was 

$936 million at September 30, 2016, and $1.9 billion at 
December 31, 2015, of nonaccretable difference to absorb losses 
for PCI loans, which totaled $17.7 billion at September 30, 2016. 
The allowance for credit losses is lower than otherwise would 
have been required without PCI loan accounting. As a result of 
PCI loans, certain ratios of the Company may not be directly 
comparable with credit-related metrics for other financial 
institutions. Additionally, loans purchased at fair value, including 
loans from the GE Capital business acquisitions, generally reflect 
a lifetime credit loss adjustment and therefore do not initially 
require additions to the allowance as is typically associated with 
loan growth. For additional information on PCI loans, see the 
“Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Purchased 
Credit-Impaired Loans” section and Note 5 (Loans and Allowance 
for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. 

The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total 

nonaccrual loans may fluctuate significantly from period to 
period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the 
portfolio, borrower credit strength and the value and 
marketability of collateral. Our nonaccrual loans consisted 

primarily of real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgage 
loans at September 30, 2016. 

The allowance for credit losses increased $182 million, or 

 

1%, from December 31, 2015, due to an increase in our 
commercial allowance reflecting deterioration in the oil and gas 
portfolio, and loan growth in the commercial, automobile and 
credit card portfolios, partially offset by continued improvement 
in the residential real estate portfolios. Total provision for credit 
losses was $805 million in third quarter 2016, compared with 
$703 million in third quarter 2015. The increase in the provision 
for credit losses reflected deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio 
as well as the growth in the loan portfolios mentioned above. 

We believe the allowance for credit losses of $12.7 billion at 

September 30, 2016, was appropriate to cover credit losses 
inherent in the loan portfolio, including unfunded credit 
commitments, at that date. Approximately $1.4 billion of the 
allowance at September 30, 2016 was allocated to our oil and gas 
portfolio, compared with $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015. This 
represented 8.8% and 6.7% of total oil and gas loans outstanding 
at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
However, the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses 
inherent in the total loan portfolio. The allowance for credit

losses is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the 
date of determination, including economic or market conditions 
and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to 
the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in the 
economic and business environment, it is possible that we will 
incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance 
sheet date. Future allowance levels will be based on a variety of 
factors, including loan growth, portfolio performance and general 
economic conditions. Our process for determining the allowance 
for credit losses is discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – 
Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2015 Form 10-K. 

assumptions that are subject to change. The high end of this 
range of reasonably possible losses exceeded our recorded 
liability by $191 million at September 30, 2016, and was 
determined based upon modifying the assumptions 
(particularly to assume significant changes in investor 
repurchase demand practices) used in our best estimate of 
probable loss to reflect what we believe to be the high end of 
reasonably possible adverse assumptions. 

For additional information on our repurchase liability, see 

the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Liability 
For Mortgage Loan Repurchase Losses” section in our 2015 
 
Form 10-K and Note 8 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to 
Financial Statements in this Report. 

 

RISKS RELATING TO SERVICING ACTIVITIES  In addition to 
servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer and/or 
master servicer of residential mortgage loans included in GSE-
guaranteed mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed 
mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed 
mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as 
for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors. In 
connection with our servicing activities, we have entered into 
various settlements with federal and state regulators to resolve 
certain alleged servicing issues and practices. In general, these 
settlements required us to provide customers with loan 
modification relief, refinancing relief, and foreclosure 
prevention and assistance, as well as imposed certain monetary 
penalties on us. 

For additional information about the risks and various 
settlements related to our servicing activities, see the “Risk 
Management – Credit Risk Management – Risks Relating to 
Servicing Activities” section in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

LIABILITY FOR MORTGAGE LOAN REPURCHASE LOSSES 
In connection with our sales and securitization of residential 
mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a 
mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to 
various representations and warranties that reflect 
management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could 
have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently 
service those loans, based on a combination of factors. Our 
mortgage repurchase liability estimation process also 
incorporates a forecast of repurchase demands associated with 
mortgage insurance rescission activity. 

Because we typically retain the servicing for the mortgage 

loans we sell or securitize, we believe the quality of our 
residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio provides helpful 
information in evaluating our repurchase liability. Of the 
$1.6 trillion in the residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
at September 30, 2016, 95% was current and less than 2% was 
subprime at origination. Our combined delinquency and 
foreclosure rate on this portfolio was 4.63% at September 30, 
2016, compared with 5.18% at December 31, 2015. Two percent 
of this portfolio is private label securitizations for which we 
originated the loans and, therefore have some repurchase risk. 

The overall level of unresolved repurchase demands and 

mortgage insurance rescissions outstanding at September 30, 
2016, was $57 million, representing 298 loans, down from a 
year ago both in number of outstanding loans and in total dollar 
balances as we observed a decline in new demands, continued 
to work through the outstanding demands and mortgage 
insurance rescissions, and resolved certain exposures. 
Our liability for mortgage repurchases, included in 

“Accrued expenses and other liabilities” in our consolidated 
balance sheet, represents our best estimate of the probable loss 
that we expect to incur for various representations and 
warranties in the contractual provisions of our sales of 
mortgage loans. The liability was $239 million at September 30, 
2016, and $378 million at December 31, 2015. In third quarter 
2016, we released $13 million, which increased net gains on 
mortgage loan origination/sales activities, compared with a 
release of $6 million in third quarter 2015. The release in third 
quarter 2016 was due to a re-estimation of our liability based on 
recently observed trends. We incurred net losses on 
repurchased loans and investor reimbursements totaling 
$3 million in third quarter 2016, compared with $13 million in 
third quarter 2015. 

Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates 

underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of 
losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability 
that are reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of 
possible loss for representations and warranties does not 
represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available 
information, significant judgment, and a number of 

44 

Asset/Liability Management 
Asset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and 
managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. 
Primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides 
with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors (Board), 
which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial 
risk management policies and processes used to assess and 
manage these risks. Primary oversight of liquidity and funding 
resides with the Risk Committee of the Board. At the 
management level we utilize a Corporate Asset/Liability 
Management Committee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of 
senior financial, risk, and business executives, to oversee these 
risks and report on them periodically to the Board’s Finance 
Committee and Risk Committee as appropriate. Each of our 
principal lines of business has its own asset/liability management 
committee and process linked to the Corporate ALCO process. As 
discussed in more detail for trading activities below, we employ 
separate management level oversight specific to market risk. 
 
INTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk, which potentially can 
have a significant earnings impact, is an integral part of being a 
financial intermediary. 

We assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under 
various earnings simulations using many interest rate scenarios 
that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree of 
change over time, the speed of change and the projected shape of 
the yield curve. These simulations require assumptions regarding 
how changes in interest rates and related market conditions 
could influence drivers of earnings and balance sheet 
composition such as loan origination demand, prepayment 
speeds, deposit balances and mix, as well as pricing strategies. 

Our risk measures include both net interest income 

sensitivity and interest rate sensitive noninterest income and 
expense impacts. We refer to the combination of these exposures 
as interest rate sensitive earnings. In general, the Company is 
positioned to benefit from higher interest rates. Currently, our 
profile is such that net interest income will benefit from higher 
interest rates as our assets reprice faster and to a greater degree 
than our liabilities, and, in response to lower market rates, our 
assets will reprice downward and to a greater degree than our 
liabilities. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and 
expense is largely driven by mortgage activity, and tends to move 
in the opposite direction of our net interest income. So, in 
response to higher interest rates, mortgage activity, including 
refinancing activity, generally declines. And in response to lower 
rates, mortgage activity generally increases. Mortgage results in 
our simulations are also impacted by the valuation of MSRs and 
related hedge positions. See the “Risk Management – Asset/ 
Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and 
Market Risk” section in this Report for more information. 

The degree to which these sensitivities offset each other is 

dependent upon the timing and magnitude of changes in interest 
rates, and the slope of the yield curve. During a transition to a 
higher or lower interest rate environment, a reduction or increase 
in interest-sensitive earnings from the mortgage banking 
business could occur quickly, while the benefit or detriment from 
balance sheet repricing could take more time to develop. For 
example, our lower rate scenarios (scenario 1 and scenario 2) in 
the following table measure a decline in interest rates versus our 
most likely scenario. Although the performance in these rate 
scenarios contain benefits from increased mortgage banking 
activity, the result is lower earnings relative to the most likely 
scenario over time given pressure on net interest income. The 
higher rate scenarios (scenario 3 and scenario 4) measure the 
impact of varying degrees of rising short-term and long-term 

interest rates over the course of the forecast horizon relative to 
the most likely scenario, both resulting in positive earnings 
sensitivity. 

For more information about the various causes of interest 

rate risk, see the "Risk Management–Asset/Liability 
Management–Interest Rate Risk" section in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

As of September 30, 2016, our most recent simulations 

estimate earnings at risk over the next 24 months under a range 
of both lower and higher interest rates. The results of the 
simulations are summarized in Table 30, indicating cumulative 
net income after tax earnings sensitivity relative to the most likely 
earnings plan over the 24 month horizon (a positive range 
indicates a beneficial earnings sensitivity measurement relative to 
the most likely earnings plan and a negative range indicates a 
detrimental earnings sensitivity relative to the most likely 
earnings plan).

We use the investment securities portfolio and exchange-
traded and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to 
hedge our interest rate exposures. See the “Balance Sheet 
Analysis – Investment Securities” section in this Report for more 
information on the use of the available-for-sale and held-to­
maturity securities portfolios. The notional or contractual 
amount, credit risk amount and fair value of the derivatives used 
to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of September 30, 
2016, and December 31, 2015, are presented in Note 12 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. We use 
derivatives for asset/liability management in two main ways: 
• 	

to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability 
instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial 
loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to 
floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and 
to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, 
funded mortgage loans and MSRs using interest rate swaps, 
swaptions, futures, forwards and options.

MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK 
We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us 
to various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks. 
For more information on mortgage banking interest rate and 
market risk, see the "Risk Management – Asset/Liability 
Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market 
Risk" section in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

While our hedging activities are designed to balance our 

mortgage banking interest rate risks, the financial instruments 
we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income 
being hedged. For example, the change in the value of ARM 
production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates 
may or may not be fully offset by Treasury and LIBOR index-
based financial instruments used as economic hedges for such 
ARMs. Additionally, hedge-carry income on our economic hedges 
for the MSRs may not continue at recent levels if the spread 
between short-term and long-term rates decreases or there are 

45 

Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

other changes in the market for mortgage forwards that affect the 
implied carry. 

This category also includes positions we use to manage our 
exposure to customer transactions. 

In our customer accommodation trading, we serve as 

intermediary between buyer and seller. For example, we may 
purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to manage 
interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into offsetting 
derivative or security positions with a separate counterparty or 
exchange to manage our exposure to the derivative with our 
customer. We earn income on this activity based on the 
transaction price difference between the customer and offsetting 
derivative or security positions, which is reflected in the fair value 
changes of the positions recorded in net gains on trading 
activities. 

Customer accommodation trading also includes net gains 

related to market-making activities in which we take positions to 
facilitate customer order flow. For example, we may own 
securities recorded as trading assets (long positions) or sold 
securities we have not yet purchased, recorded as trading 
liabilities (short positions), typically on a short-term basis, to 
facilitate support of buying and selling demand from our 
customers. As a market maker in these securities, we earn income 
due to: (1) the difference between the price paid or received for 
the purchase and sale of the security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net 
interest income, and (3) the change in fair value of the long or 
short positions during the short-term period held on our balance 
sheet. Additionally, we may enter into separate derivative or 
security positions to manage our exposure related to our long or 
short security positions. Income earned on this type of market-
making activity is reflected in the fair value changes of these 
positions recorded in net gains on trading activities. 

 

Economic hedges and other  Economic hedges in trading are not 
designated in a hedge accounting relationship and exclude 
economic hedging related to our asset/liability risk management 
and mortgage banking risk management activities. Economic 
hedging activities include the use of trading securities to 
economically hedge risk exposures related to non-trading 
activities or derivatives to hedge risk exposures related to trading 
assets or trading liabilities. Economic hedges are unrelated to our 
customer accommodation activities. Other activities include 
financial assets held for investment purposes that we elected to 
carry at fair value with changes in fair value recorded to earnings 
in order to mitigate accounting measurement mismatches or 
avoid embedded derivative accounting complexities. 
 
Daily Trading-Related Revenue  Table 32 provides information 
on the distribution of daily trading-related revenues for the 
Company’s trading portfolio. This trading-related revenue is 
defined as the change in value of the trading assets and trading 
liabilities, trading-related net interest income, and trading-
related intra-day gains and losses. Net trading-related revenue 
does not include activity related to long-term positions held for 
economic hedging purposes, period-end adjustments, and other 
activity not representative of daily price changes driven by 
market factors. 

 

The total carrying value of our residential and commercial 

  

MSRs was $11.8 billion at September 30, 2016, and $13.7 billion 
at December 31, 2015. The weighted-average note rate on our 
portfolio of loans serviced for others was 4.28% at September 30, 
2016, and 4.37% at December 31, 2015. The carrying value of our 
total MSRs represented 0.69% of mortgage loans serviced for 
others at September 30, 2016, and 0.77% at December 31, 2015. 
 
MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES  The Finance 
Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the acceptable 
market risk appetite for our trading activities. We engage in 
trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk 
management activities of our customers (which involves 
transactions that are recorded as trading assets and liabilities on 
our balance sheet), and to execute economic hedging to manage 
certain balance sheet risks. These activities largely occur within 
our Wholesale Banking businesses and to a lesser extent other 
divisions of the Company. All of our trading assets and liabilities, 
including securities, foreign exchange transactions, commodity 
transactions, and derivatives are carried at fair value. Income 
earned related to these trading activities include net interest 
income and changes in fair value related to trading assets and 
liabilities. Net interest income earned on trading assets and 
liabilities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense 
components of our income statement. Changes in fair value of 
trading assets and liabilities are reflected in net gains on trading 
activities, a component of noninterest income in our income 
statement.

Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse 
changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit 
spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, commodity prices, 
mortgage rates, and market liquidity. Market risk is intrinsic to 
the Company’s sales and trading, market making, investing, and 
risk management activities. 

The Company uses value-at-risk (VaR) metrics 

complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in 
measuring and monitoring market risk. VaR is a statistical risk 
measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse moves 
in the financial markets. 

Trading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the 

market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The

Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes 
to establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. 
Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions classified 
as trading assets or trading liabilities on our balance sheet. 

Table 33 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk 

category. As presented in the table, average Company Trading 
General VaR was $22 million for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2016, compared with $21 million for the quarter

(1) 	 The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the 
risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not 
meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days.

Asset/Liability Management (continued) 

Regulatory Market Risk Capital  reflects U.S. regulatory agency 
risk-based capital regulations that are based on the Basel 
Committee Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision. The Company must calculate regulatory capital 
under the Basel III market risk capital rule, which requires 
banking organizations with significant trading activities to adjust 
their capital requirements to reflect the market risks of those 
activities based on comprehensive and risk sensitive methods and 
models. The market risk capital rule is intended to cover the risk 
of loss in value of covered positions due to changes in market 
conditions. 
 
Composition of Material Portfolio of Covered Positions  The 
positions that are “covered” by the market risk capital rule are 
generally a subset of our trading assets and trading liabilities, 
specifically those held by the Company for the purpose of short-
term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or 
expected short-term price movements, or to lock in arbitrage 
profits. Positions excluded from market risk regulatory capital 
treatment are subject to the credit risk capital rules applicable to 
the “non-covered” trading positions. 

The material portfolio of the Company’s “covered” positions 
is predominantly concentrated in the trading assets and trading 
liabilities managed within Wholesale Banking where the 
substantial portion of market risk capital resides. Wholesale 
Banking engages in the fixed income, traded credit, foreign 
exchange, equities, and commodities markets businesses. Other 
business segments hold smaller trading positions covered under 
the market risk capital rule. 

Regulatory Market Risk Capital Components  The capital 
required for market risk on the Company’s “covered” positions is 

 
Table 34:  Regulatory 10-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category 

  

determined by internally developed models or standardized 
specific risk charges. The market risk regulatory capital models 
are subject to internal model risk management and validation. 
The models are continuously monitored and enhanced in 
response to changes in market conditions, improvements in 
system capabilities, and changes in the Company’s market risk 
exposure. The Company is required to obtain and has received 
prior written approval from its regulators before using its 
internally developed models to calculate the market risk capital 
charge. 

Basel III prescribes various VaR measures in the 

determination of regulatory capital and RWAs. The Company 
uses the same VaR models for both market risk management 
purposes as well as regulatory capital calculations. For regulatory 
purposes, we use the following metrics to determine the 
Company’s market risk capital requirements: 
 
General VaR measures the risk of broad market movements such 
as changes in the level of credit spreads, interest rates, equity 
prices, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. General 
VaR uses historical simulation analysis based on 99% confidence 
level and a 10-day holding period. 

Table 34 shows the General VaR measure categorized by 

major risk categories. Average 10-day Company Regulatory 
General VaR was $13 million for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2016, compared with $27 million for the quarter 
ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by 
changes in portfolio composition.

Specific Risk measures the risk of loss that could result from 
factors other than broad market movements, or name-specific 
market risk. Specific Risk uses Monte Carlo simulation analysis 
based on a 99% confidence level and a 10-day holding period. 
 
Total VaR (as presented in Table 35) is composed of General VaR 
and Specific Risk and uses the previous 12 months of historical 
market data in compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Total Stressed VaR (as presented in Table 35) uses a historical 
period of significant financial stress over a continuous 12 month 
period using historically available market data and is composed 

of Stressed General VaR and Stressed Specific Risk. Total 
Stressed VaR uses the same methodology and models as Total 
VaR.

losses due to both issuer default and migration risk at the 99.9% 
confidence level over the one-year capital horizon under the 
assumption of constant level of risk or a constant position 
assumption. The model covers non-securitized credit-sensitive 
trading products. 

The Company calculates Incremental Risk by generating a 
portfolio loss distribution using Monte Carlo simulation, which 

48 

assumes numerous scenarios, where an assumption is made that 
the portfolio’s composition remains constant for a one-year time 
horizon. Individual issuer credit grade migration and issuer 
default risk is modeled through generation of the issuer’s credit 
rating transition based upon statistical modeling. Correlation 
between credit grade migration and default is captured by a 
multifactor proprietary model which takes into account industry 
classifications as well as regional effects. Additionally, the impact 
of market and issuer specific concentrations is reflected in the 
modeling framework by assignment of a higher charge for 

 
Table 35:  Market Risk Regulatory Capital Modeled Components 

  

portfolios that have increasing concentrations in particular 
issuers or sectors. Lastly, the model captures product basis risk; 
that is, it reflects the material disparity between a position and its 
hedge.

Securitized Products Charge  Basel III requires a separate market 
risk capital charge for positions classified as a securitization or 
re-securitization. The primary criteria for classification as a 
securitization are whether there is a transfer of risk and whether 
the credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been 
separated into at least two tranches reflecting different levels of 
seniority. Covered trading securitizations positions include 
consumer and commercial asset-backed securities (ABS), 
commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential 
mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), and collateralized loan and 
other debt obligations (CLO/CDO) positions. The securitization 
capital requirements are the greater of the capital requirements 
of the net long or short exposure, and are capped at the 
maximum loss that could be incurred on any given transaction. 

Table 36 shows the aggregate net fair market value of 

securities and derivative securitization positions by exposure type 
that meet the regulatory definition of a covered trading 
securitization position at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 
2015.

Securitization Due Diligence and Risk Monitoring  The market 
risk capital rule requires that the Company conduct due diligence 
on the risk of each position within three days of the purchase of a 
securitization position. The Company’s due diligence seeks to 
provide an understanding of the features that would materially 
affect the performance of a securitization or re-securitization. The 
due diligence analysis is re-performed on a quarterly basis for 
each securitization and re-securitization position. The Company 
uses an automated solution to track the due diligence associated 
with securitization activity. The Company aims to manage the 
risks associated with securitization and re-securitization 
positions through the use of offsetting positions and portfolio 
diversification. 

 

Standardized Specific Risk Charge  For debt and equity positions 
that are not evaluated by the approved internal specific risk 
models, a regulatory prescribed standard specific risk charge is 
applied. The standard specific risk add-on for sovereign entities, 
public sector entities, and depository institutions is based on the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) country risk classifications (CRC) and the remaining 
contractual maturity of the position. These risk add-ons for debt 
positions range from 0.25% to 12%. The add-on for corporate 
debt is based on creditworthiness and the remaining contractual 
maturity of the position. All other types of debt positions are 
subject to an 8% add-on. The standard specific risk add-on for 
equity positions is generally 8%. 

 

Comprehensive Risk Charge / Correlation Trading  The market 
risk capital rule requires capital for correlation trading positions. 
The Company's remaining correlation trading exposure covered 
under the market risk capital rule matured in fourth quarter 
2014. 

 

Table 37 summarizes the market risk-based capital 

requirements charge and market RWAs in accordance with the 
Basel III market risk capital rule as of September 30, 2016, and

VaR Backtesting  The market risk capital rule requires 
backtesting as one form of validation of the VaR model. 
Backtesting is a comparison of the daily VaR estimate with the 
actual clean profit and loss (clean P&L) as defined by the market 
risk capital rule. Clean P&L is the change in the value of the 
Company’s covered trading positions that would have occurred 
had previous end-of-day covered trading positions remained 
unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, commissions, net interest 
income, and intraday trading gains and losses). The backtesting 
analysis compares the daily Total VaR for each of the trading days 
in the preceding 12 months with the net clean P&L. Clean P&L 
does not include credit adjustments and other activity not 
representative of daily price changes driven by market risk 
factors. The clean P&L measure of revenue is used to evaluate the 
performance of the Total VaR and is not comparable to our actual 
daily trading net revenues, as reported elsewhere in this Report. 

Any observed clean P&L loss in excess of the Total VaR is 

considered a market risk regulatory capital backtesting exception. 
The actual number of exceptions (that is, the number of business 
days for which the clean P&L losses exceed the corresponding 1­
day, 99% Total VaR measure) over the preceding 12 months is 
used to determine the capital multiplier for the capital 
calculation. The number of actual backtesting exceptions is 
dependent on current market performance relative to historic 
market volatility in addition to model performance and 
assumptions. This capital multiplier increases from a minimum 
of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of 
exceptions. No backtesting exceptions occurred over the 
preceding 12 months. Backtesting is also performed at granular 
levels within the Company. 

Table 39 shows daily Total VaR (1-day, 99%) used for 

regulatory market risk capital backtesting for the 12 months 
ended September 30, 2016. The Company’s average Total VaR for 
third quarter 2016 was $32 million with a low of $23 million and 
a high of $38 million. The increase in Total 1-day VaR is 
attributable to index trading activity.

The largest contributor to the changes to market risk 

regulatory capital and RWAs in third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016 were associated with changes in positions due to 
normal trading activity. RWAs in third quarter 2016 primarily 
increased from an increase in index trading.

Market Risk Governance, Measurement, Monitoring and Model 
Risk Management  We employ a well-defined and structured 
market risk governance process and market risk measurement 
process, which incorporates value-at-risk (VaR) measurements 
combined with sensitivity analysis and stress testing to help us 
monitor our market risk. These monitoring measurements 
require the use of market risk models, which we govern by our 
Corporate Model Risk policies and procedures. For more 
information on our governance, measurement, monitoring, and 
model risk management practices, see the "Risk Management – 
Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities" 
section in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

  

MARKET RISK – EQUITY INVESTMENTS  We are directly and 
indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make 
and manage direct equity investments in start-up businesses, 
emerging growth companies, management buy-outs, acquisitions 
and corporate recapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated 
funds that make similar private equity investments. These private 
equity investments are made within capital allocations approved 
by management and the Board. The Board’s policy is to review 
business developments, key risks and historical returns for the 
private equity investment portfolio at least annually. 
Management reviews these investments at least quarterly and 
assesses them for possible OTTI. For nonmarketable 
investments, the analysis is based on facts and circumstances of 
each individual investment and the expectations for that 
investment’s cash flows and capital needs, the viability of its 
business model and our exit strategy. Nonmarketable 
investments include private equity investments accounted for 
under the cost method, equity method and fair value option. 

In conjunction with the March 2008 initial public offering 

(IPO) of Visa, Inc. (Visa), we received approximately 20.7 million 
shares of Visa Class B common stock, the class which was 
apportioned to member banks of Visa at the time of the IPO. To 
manage our exposure to Visa and realize the value of the 
appreciated Visa shares, we incrementally sold these shares 

through a series of sales over the past few years, thereby 
eliminating this position as of September 30, 2015. As part of 
these sales, we agreed to compensate the buyer for any additional 
contributions to a litigation settlement fund for the litigation 
matters associated with the Class B shares we sold. Our exposure 
to this retained litigation risk has been updated quarterly and is 
reflected on our balance sheet. For additional information about 
the associated litigation matters, see the "Interchange Litigation" 
section in Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in the 
2015 Form 10-K as supplemented by Note 11 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in our 2016 Quarterly Reports on Form 
10-Q. 

As part of our business to support our customers, we trade 

public equities, listed/OTC equity derivatives and convertible 
bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. We also 
have marketable equity securities in the available-for-sale 
securities portfolio, including securities relating to our venture 
capital activities. We manage these investments within capital 
risk limits approved by management and the Board and 
monitored by Corporate ALCO and the Corporate Market Risk 
Committee. Gains and losses on these securities are recognized in 
net income when realized and periodically include OTTI charges. 

Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect 

our net income by (1) the value of third party assets under 
management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability 
to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock 
market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and 
other business activities. Each business line monitors and 
manages these indirect risks. 

Table 40 provides information regarding our marketable and 
nonmarketable equity investments as of September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015.

LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING  The objective of effective liquidity 
management is to ensure that we can meet customer loan 
requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals and other 
cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating 
conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or 
market stress. To achieve this objective, the Board of Directors 
establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient asset-based 
liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid 
over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These 
guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate 
ALCO and on a quarterly basis by the Board of Directors. These 
guidelines are established and monitored for both the 
consolidated company and for the Parent on a stand-alone basis 
to ensure that the Parent is a source of strength for its regulated, 
deposit-taking banking subsidiaries. 

 
Table 41:  Primary Sources of Liquidity 

  

Liquidity Standards  On September 3, 2014, the FRB, OCC 
and FDIC issued a final rule that implements a quantitative 
liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio 
(LCR) established by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires banking institutions, such 
as Wells Fargo, to hold high-quality liquid assets, such as central 
bank reserves and government and corporate debt that can be 
converted easily and quickly into cash, in an amount equal to or 
greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day 
stress period. A minimum LCR of 90 percent was required as of 
January 1, 2016, and will increase to 100 percent on January 1, 
2017. These minimum requirements are applicable to the 
Company on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository 
institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion. In addition, 
the FRB finalized rules imposing enhanced liquidity management 
standards on large bank holding companies (BHC) such as Wells 
Fargo, and has proposed a rule that would require large bank 
holding companies to publicly disclose on a quarterly basis 
certain quantitative and qualitative information regarding their 
LCR calculations. 

The FRB, OCC and FDIC recently proposed a rule that would 

implement a stable funding requirement, the net stable funding 
ratio (NSFR), which would require large banking organizations, 
such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a sufficient amount of stable 
funding in relation to their assets, derivative exposures and 
commitments over a one-year horizon period. As proposed, the 
rule would become effective on January 1, 2018. 

Liquidity Sources  We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, 
cash equivalents and unencumbered high-quality, liquid 
securities. These assets make up our primary sources of liquidity 
which are presented in Table 41. Our cash is predominantly on 
deposit with the Federal Reserve. Securities included as part of 
our primary sources of liquidity are comprised of U.S. Treasury 
and federal agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities issued 
by federal agencies within our investment securities portfolio. We 
believe these securities provide quick sources of liquidity through 
sales or by pledging to obtain financing, regardless of market 
conditions. Some of these securities are within the held-to­
maturity portion of our investment securities portfolio and as 
such are not intended for sale but may be pledged to obtain 
financing. Some of the legal entities within our consolidated 
group of companies are subject to various regulatory, tax, legal 
and other restrictions that can limit the transferability of their 
funds. We believe we maintain adequate liquidity for these 
entities in consideration of such funds transfer restrictions.

In addition to our primary sources of liquidity shown in 

Table 41, liquidity is also available through the sale or financing 
of other securities including trading and/or available-for-sale 
securities, as well as through the sale, securitization or financing 
of loans, to the extent such securities and loans are not 

encumbered. In addition, other securities in our held-to-maturity 
portfolio, to the extent not encumbered, may be pledged to obtain 
financing. 

Deposits have historically provided a sizeable source of 

relatively low-cost funds. Deposits were 133% of total loans at

both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Additional 
funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term 
borrowings.

We access domestic and international capital markets for 

long-term funding (generally greater than one year) through 
issuances of registered debt securities, private placements and 
asset-backed secured funding. 

Long-Term Debt  We issue long-term debt in a variety of 
maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to 
maintain an appropriate maturity profile. Long-term debt of 
 
$254.8 billion at September 30, 2016, increased $55.3 billion 
from December 31, 2015, including $24.4 billion in Parent

Parent  Under SEC rules, our Parent is classified as a “well­
known seasoned issuer,” which allows it to file a registration 
statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. In May 
2014, the Parent filed a registration statement with the SEC for 
the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, preferred stock 
and other securities. The Parent’s ability to issue debt and other 
securities under this registration statement is limited by the debt 
issuance authority granted by the Board. As of September 30, 
2016, the Parent was authorized by the Board to issue $60 billion 
 
in outstanding short-term debt and $170 billion in outstanding 
long-term debt. At September 30, 2016, the Parent had available 
$40.5 billion in short-term debt issuance authority and 
$29.5 billion in long-term debt issuance authority. In October 
2016, the Board decreased the Parent’s short-term debt issuance 
authority from $60 billion to $50 billion and increased the 
Parent’s long-term debt issuance authority from $170 billion to 
$180 billion. The Parent’s debt issuance authority granted by the 
Board includes short-term and long-term debt issued to affiliates. 
During the first nine months of 2016, the Parent issued 
$23.9 billion of senior notes, of which $15.8 billion were 
registered with the SEC. The Parent issued $2.0 billion of 
subordinated notes during the first nine months of 2016, all of 
which were registered with the SEC. In addition, in October 2016, 
the Parent issued $6.3 billion of senior notes, all of which were 
registered with the SEC. 

The Parent’s proceeds from securities issued were used for 

general corporate purposes, and, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, we expect the 
proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the 
same purposes. Depending on market conditions, we may 
purchase our outstanding debt securities from time to time in 
privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer, 
or otherwise. 

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is authorized 
by its board of directors to issue $100 billion in outstanding 
short-term debt and $125 billion in outstanding long-term debt. 
At September 30, 2016, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had available 
$100 billion in short-term debt issuance authority and 
$34.5 billion in long-term debt issuance authority. In April 2015, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. established a $100 billion bank note 
program under which, subject to any other debt outstanding 
under the limits described above, it may issue $50 billion in 
outstanding short-term senior notes and $50 billion in 
outstanding long-term senior or subordinated notes. At 
September 30, 2016, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had remaining

issuance capacity under the bank note program of $50.0 billion 
 
in short-term senior notes and $41.0 billion in long-term senior 
or subordinated notes. During the first nine months of 2016, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. issued $10.0 billion of unregistered 
senior notes, of which $9.0 billion were issued under the bank 
note program. In addition, during the first nine months of 2016, 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. executed advances of $31.6 billion with 
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, and as of 
September 30, 2016, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. had outstanding 
advances of $68.7 billion across the Federal Home Loan Bank 
System. 

Credit Ratings  Investors in the long-term capital markets, as 
well as other market participants, generally will consider, among 
other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment 
decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many 
quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, 
liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of 
earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the 
probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support 
for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these 
factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, 
our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants. 

On October 4, 2016, Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") affirmed the 
Company's ratings and revised the rating outlook to negative 
from stable. Fitch noted that the outlook was revised given the 
uncertain impact to the Company's franchise following the 
regulatory settlements regarding sales practices in the retail 
bank. On October 18, 2016, Standard and Poor's (S&P) also 
affirmed the Company's ratings and revised the rating outlook to 
negative from stable, noting similar concerns. Both the Parent 
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. remain among the top-rated financial 
firms in the U.S. 

See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” 
section in this Report and the "Risk Factors" section in our 2015 
Form 10-K for additional information regarding our credit 
ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would 
have on our liquidity and operations, as well as Note 12 
(Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for 
information regarding additional collateral and funding 
obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the 
event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade. 

The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 

as of September 30, 2016, are presented in Table 44.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK MEMBERSHIP  The Federal 
Home Loan Banks (the FHLBs) are a group of cooperatives that 
lending institutions use to finance housing and economic 
development in local communities. We are a member of the 
FHLBs based in Dallas, Des Moines and San Francisco. Each 
member of the FHLBs is required to maintain a minimum 

investment in capital stock of the applicable FHLB. The board of 
directors of each FHLB can increase the minimum investment 
requirements in the event it has concluded that additional capital 
is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital 
requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment 
requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of 

54 

the Federal Housing Finance Board. Because the extent of any 
obligation to increase our investment in any of the FHLBs 
depends entirely upon the occurrence of a future event, potential 
future payments to the FHLBs are not determinable. 

Capital Management 

We have an active program for managing capital through a 
comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall 
capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an 
amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance 
objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. 
We primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of 
earnings net of dividends as well as the issuance of preferred 
stock and long and short-term debt. Retained earnings increased 
 
$9.4 billion from December 31, 2015, predominantly from 
Wells Fargo net income of $16.7 billion, less common and 
preferred stock dividends of $7.0 billion. During third quarter 
2016, we issued 13.7 million shares of common stock, and 
repurchased 38.3 million shares of common stock in open market 
transactions, private transactions and from employee benefit 
plans, at a cost of $1.8 billion. We also entered into a $750 
million forward repurchase contract with an unrelated third party 
in October 2016 that is expected to settle in first quarter 2017 for 
approximately 17 million shares. For additional information 
about our forward repurchase agreements, see Note 1 (Summary 
of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this 
Report. 
 
Regulatory Capital Guidelines 
The Company and each of our insured depository institutions are 
subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital (RBC) 
guidelines establish a risk-adjusted ratio relating capital to 
different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as 
discussed below. 

 
RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The 
Company is subject to final and interim final rules issued by 
federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital 
requirements for U.S. banking organizations. These rules are 
based on international guidelines for determining regulatory 
capital issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
(BCBS). The federal banking regulators’ capital rules, among 
other things, require on a fully phased-in basis: 
• 	

a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 9.0%, 
comprised of a 4.5% minimum requirement plus a capital 
conservation buffer of 2.5% and for us, as a global 
systemically important bank (G-SIB), a capital surcharge 
to be calculated annually, which is 2.0% based on our year-
end 2014 data; 
a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%, comprised of a 

6.0% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 

buffer of 2.5% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.0%;
 
a minimum total capital ratio of 12.5%, comprised of a 

8.0% minimum requirement plus the capital conservation 

buffer of 2.5% and the G-SIB capital surcharge of 2.0%;
 
a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5% to be added 
to the minimum capital ratios, which is currently not in 
effect but could be imposed by regulators at their 
discretion if it is determined that a period of excessive 
credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic 
risk; 
a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%; and 

• 	

• 	

• 	

• 	

• 	

a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 5.0% 

(comprised of a 3.0% minimum requirement plus a 

supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%) for large and 

internationally active bank holding companies (BHCs).
 

We were required to comply with the final Basel III capital 

rules beginning January 2014, with certain provisions subject 
to phase-in periods. The Basel III capital rules are scheduled to 
be fully phased in by the end of 2021. The Basel III capital rules 
contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a 
Standardized Approach, which replaced Basel I, and an 
Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, 
including Wells Fargo. Accordingly, in the assessment of our 
capital adequacy, we must report the lower of our CET1, tier 1 
and total capital ratios calculated under the Standardized 
Approach and under the Advanced Approach. 

Because the Company has been designated as a G-SIB, we 

will also be subject to the FRB’s rule implementing the additional 
capital surcharge of between 1.0-4.5% on G-SIBs. Under the rule, 
we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and 
use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method 
one) will consider our size, interconnectedness, cross-
jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent 
with a methodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB). The second (method two) will use similar 
inputs, but will replace substitutability with use of short-term 
wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges 
than the BCBS methodology. The phase-in period for the G-SIB 
surcharge began on January 1, 2016 and will become fully 
effective on January 1, 2019. Based on year-end 2014 data, our 
2016 G-SIB surcharge under method two is 2.0% of the 
Company’s RWAs, which is the higher of method one and method 
two. Because the G-SIB surcharge is calculated annually based on 
data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is 
subject to change in future years. Under the Standardized 
Approach (fully phased-in), our CET1 ratio of 10.71% exceeded 
the minimum of 9.0% by 171 basis points at September 30, 2016.

tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period end. 

(3) 	 Under the Advanced Approach the allowance for credit losses that exceeds expected credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, to the extent the excess 

allowance does not exceed 0.6% of Advanced credit RWAs, and under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is includable in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% 
of Standardized credit RWAs, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted from total RWAs. 

(4) 	 RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with 

internal rating grades. Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of operating loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal 
processes or systems. 

(5) 	 Under the regulatory guidelines for risk-based capital, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to 

one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category 
is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total 
RWAs.

Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and 
represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling 
interests, and goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets 
(including goodwill and intangible assets associated with certain 
of our nonmarketable equity investments but excluding mortgage 
servicing rights), net of applicable deferred taxes. These tangible 
common equity ratios are as follows: 
• 	

Tangible book value per common share, which represents 
tangible common equity divided by common shares 
outstanding. 

• 	 Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which 

represents our annualized earnings contribution as a 
percentage of tangible common equity. 

 
Table 49:  Tangible Common Equity 

  

The methodology of determining tangible common equity 

may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible 
book value per common share and return on average tangible 
common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful 
financial measures because they enable investors and others to 
assess the Company's use of equity. 

Table 49 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP 

financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

Capital Management (continued) 

SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  In April 2014, federal 
banking regulators finalized a rule that enhances the SLR 
requirements for BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured 
depository institutions. The SLR consists of Tier 1 capital divided 
by the Company’s total leverage exposure. Total leverage 
exposure consists of the total average on-balance sheet assets, 
plus off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments 
and derivative exposures, less amounts permitted to be deducted 
from Tier 1 capital. The rule, which becomes effective on January 
1, 2018, will require a covered BHC to maintain a SLR of at least 
5.0% (comprised of the 3.0% minimum requirement plus a 
supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%) to avoid restrictions on 
capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The rule 
will also require that all of our insured depository institutions 
maintain a SLR of 6.0% under applicable regulatory capital 
adequacy guidelines. In September 2014, federal banking 
regulators finalized additional changes to the SLR requirements 
to implement revisions to the Basel III leverage framework 
finalized by the BCBS in January 2014. These additional changes, 
among other things, modify the methodology for including off-
balance sheet items, including credit derivatives, repo-style 
transactions and lines of credit, in the denominator of the SLR, 
and will become effective on January 1, 2018. At September 30, 
2016, our SLR for the Company was 7.7% assuming full phase-in 
of the Advanced Approach capital framework. Based on our 
review, our current leverage levels would exceed the applicable 
requirements for each of our insured depository institutions as 
well. The fully phased-in SLR is considered a non-GAAP financial 
measure that is used by management, bank regulatory agencies, 
investors and analysts to assess and monitor the Company’s 
leverage exposure. See Table 50 for information regarding the 
calculation and components of the SLR.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL MATTERS  In October 2015, 
the FRB proposed rules to address the amount of equity and 
unsecured long-term debt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its 
resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as Total Loss 
Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under the proposed rules, U.S. G-
SIBs would be required to have a minimum TLAC amount 
(consisting of CET1 capital and additional tier 1 capital issued 
directly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external 
long-term debt) equal to the greater of (i) 18% of RWAs and (ii) 
9.5% of total leverage exposure (the denominator of the SLR 
calculation). Additionally, U.S. G-SIBs would be required to 
maintain a TLAC buffer equal to 2.5% of RWAs plus the firm’s 
applicable G-SIB capital surcharge calculated under method one 
plus any applicable countercyclical buffer that would be added to 
the 18% minimum in order to avoid restrictions on capital 

60 

distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The proposed 
rules would also require U.S. G-SIBs to have a minimum amount 
of eligible unsecured long-term debt equal to the greater of (i) 
6.0% of RWAs plus the firm’s applicable G-SIB capital surcharge 
calculated under method two and (ii) 4.5% of the total leverage 
exposure. In addition, the proposed rules would impose certain 
restrictions on the operations and liabilities of the top-tier or 
covered BHC in order to further facilitate an orderly resolution, 
including prohibitions on the issuance of short-term debt to 
external investors and on entering into derivatives and certain 
other types of financial contracts with external counterparties. 
The proposed rules were open for comments until 
February 1, 2016. If the proposed rules are finalized as proposed, 
we may be required to issue additional long-term debt. 

In addition, as discussed in the “Risk Management – Asset/ 

Liability Management – Liquidity and Funding – Liquidity 
Standards” section in this Report, federal banking regulators 
have issued a final rule regarding the U.S. implementation of the 
Basel III LCR and a proposed rule regarding the NSFR. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing 
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet 
regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long­
term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow 
our business, satisfy our customers' financial needs in varying 
environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return 
capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital 
structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital 
requirements including the G-SIB surcharge. Accordingly, based 
on the final Basel III capital rules under the lower of the 
Standardized or Advanced Approaches CET1 capital ratios, we 
currently target a long-term CET1 capital ratio at or in excess of 
10%, which includes a 2% G-SIB surcharge. Our capital targets 
are subject to change based on various factors, including changes 
to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large 
banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies, planned capital 
actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. 

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, large BHCs are required to 

submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB 
has any objections before making any capital distributions. The 
rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material 
changes in a BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any 
significant acquisitions. The FRB assesses the overall financial 
condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs while 
considering both quantitative and qualitative factors when 
evaluating capital plans. 

Our 2016 CCAR, which was submitted on April 4, 2016, 

included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an 
assessment of expected sources and uses of capital over a given 
planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, 
similar to the process the FRB used to conduct the 2015 CCAR. 
As part of the 2016 CCAR, the FRB also generated a supervisory 
stress test, which assumed a sharp decline in the economy and 
significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided 
by the Company to estimate performance. The FRB reviewed the 
supervisory stress results both as required under the Dodd-Frank 
Act using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and 
by taking into account the Company’s proposed capital actions. 
The FRB published its supervisory stress test results as required 
under the Dodd-Frank Act on June 23, 2016. On June 29, 2016, 
the FRB notified us that it did not object to our capital plan 
included in the 2016 CCAR. 

In addition to CCAR, federal banking regulators also require 

stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has sufficient 
capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic 

and financial conditions. These stress testing requirements set 
forth the timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and 
banks must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing 
controls, oversight and disclosure requirements. The rules also 
limit a large BHC’s ability to make capital distributions to the 
extent its actual capital issuances were less than amounts 
indicated in its capital plan. As required under the FRB’s stress 
testing rule, we must submit a mid-cycle stress test based on 
second quarter data and scenarios developed by the Company. 
We submitted the results of the mid-cycle stress test to the FRB, 
and disclosed a summary of the results in November 2016. 

Securities Repurchases 
From time to time the Board authorizes the Company to 
repurchase shares of our common stock. Although we announce 
when the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not 
give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Future 
stock repurchases may be private or open-market repurchases, 
including block transactions, accelerated or delayed block 
transactions, forward transactions, and similar transactions. 
Additionally, we may enter into plans to purchase stock that 
satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934. Various factors determine the amount and timing of 
our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the 
number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans 
and acquisitions, market conditions (including the trading price 
of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including 
the FRB’s response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk 
profile. 

In January 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of 

350 million shares of our common stock. At September 30, 2016, 
we had remaining authority to repurchase approximately 
292 million shares, subject to regulatory and legal conditions. For 
more information about share repurchases during third quarter 
2016, see Part II, Item 2 in this Report. 

Historically, our policy has been to repurchase shares under 

the “safe harbor” conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 including a limitation on the daily volume 
of repurchases. Rule 10b-18 imposes an additional daily volume 
limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or 
acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all 
of the consideration. Our management may determine that 
during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe 
harbor would otherwise be available, it is in our best interest to 
repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume 
limitation. In such cases, we intend to repurchase shares in 
compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor, 
including the standing daily volume limitation that applies 
whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition. 

In connection with our participation in the Capital Purchase 

Program (CPP), a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program 
(TARP), we issued to the U.S. Treasury Department warrants to 
purchase 110,261,688 shares of our common stock with an 
original exercise price of $34.01 per share expiring on October 
28, 2018. The terms of the warrants require the exercise price to 
be adjusted under certain circumstances when the Company’s 
quarterly common stock dividend exceeds $0.34 per share, which 
began occurring in second quarter 2014. Accordingly, with each 
quarterly common stock dividend above $0.34 per share, we 
must calculate whether an adjustment to the exercise price is 
required by the terms of the warrants, including whether certain 
minimum thresholds have been met to trigger an adjustment, 
and notify the holders of any such change. The Board authorized 
the repurchase by the Company of up to $1 billion of the 
warrants. At September 30, 2016, there were 33,137,573 warrants 
outstanding, exercisable at $33.840 per share, and $452 million 
 
of unused warrant repurchase authority. Depending on market 
conditions, we may purchase from time to time additional 
warrants in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by 
tender offer or otherwise.

Regulatory Reform 

Since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the U.S. 
financial services industry has been subject to a significant 
increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This 
increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how 
most U.S. financial services companies conduct business and has 
increased their regulatory compliance costs. 

The following supplements our discussion of the significant 
regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected 
or may affect our business contained in the "Regulatory Reform" 
and "Risk Factors" sections in our 2015 Form 10-K and the 
"Regulatory Reform" section in our 2016 First and Second 
Quarter Reports on Form 10-Q. 

  

REGULATION OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS  The 
Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) to ensure consumers receive clear and accurate 
disclosures regarding financial products and to protect them 
from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices. With respect to 
residential mortgage lending, the CFPB issued a number of final 
rules in 2013 implementing new origination, notification and 
other requirements that generally became effective in January 
2014. In November 2013, the CFPB also finalized rules 
integrating disclosures required of lenders and settlement agents 
under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate 
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). These rules, which became 
effective in October 2015, combine existing separate disclosure 
forms under the TILA and RESPA into new integrated forms and 
provide additional limitations on the fees and charges that may 
be increased from the estimates provided by lenders. In October 
2015, the CFPB finalized amendments to the rule implementing 
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, resulting in a significant 
expansion of the data points lenders will be required to collect 
beginning January 1, 2018 and report to the CFPB beginning 
January 1, 2019. The CFPB also expanded the transactions 
covered by the rule and increased the reporting frequency from 
annual to quarterly for large volume lenders, such as Wells Fargo, 
beginning January 1, 2020. With respect to other financial 
products, in October 2016, the CFPB finalized rules, most of 
which become effective on October 1, 2017, to make prepaid cards 
subject to similar consumer protections as those provided by 
more traditional debit and credit cards such as fraud protection 
and expanded access to account information. 

DEPOSIT INSURANCE ASSESSMENTS  Our subsidiary banks, 
including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., are members of the Deposit 
Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, 
the FDIC insures the deposits of our banks up to prescribed limits 
for each depositor and funds the DIF through assessments on 
member banks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are 
assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and 
an assessment rate. 

The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC greater discretion to 
manage the DIF, changed the assessment base from domestic 
deposits to consolidated average assets less average tangible 
equity, and mandated a minimum Designated Reserve Ratio 
(reserve ratio or DRR) of 1.35%. The FDIC Board adopted a 
Restoration Plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 
1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank 
Act, and, in March 2016, issued a final rule to meet this DRR 
level. The final rule, which became effective on July 1, 2016, 
imposes on insured depository institutions with $10 billion or 
more in assets, such as Wells Fargo, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per 

62 

$100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. 
The surcharge is in addition to the base assessments paid by the 
affected institutions and could significantly increase the overall 
amount of their deposit insurance assessments. The FDIC expects 
the surcharge to be in effect for approximately two years, 
however, if the DIF reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by 
December 31, 2018, the final rule provides that the FDIC will 
impose a shortfall assessment on any bank that was subject to the 
surcharge. In addition to ensuring that the DIF reserve ratio 
reaches the statutory minimum of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, 
the FDIC Board has also finalized a comprehensive, long-range 
plan for DIF management, whereby the DRR has been targeted at 
2%. 

"LIVING WILL" REQUIREMENTS AND RELATED MATTERS 
 
Rules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank 
Act require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to 
prepare and periodically revise resolution plans, so-called “living­
wills”, that would facilitate their resolution in the event of 
material distress or failure. Under the rules, resolution plans are 
required to provide strategies for resolution under the 
Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency regimes that 
can be accomplished in a reasonable period of time and in a 
manner that mitigates the risk that failure would have serious 
adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States. On 
April 12, 2016, the FRB and FDIC notified us that they had jointly 
determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible or would 
not facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. 
We were required to remedy the deficiencies in a submission that 
we provided to the FRB and FDIC on September 30, 2016, but 
have not yet received regulatory feedback on the submission. In 
the event that our submission does not adequately remedy the 
deficiencies, the FRB and FDIC may impose more stringent 
capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on us or restrict our 
growth, activities or operations until we submit a plan remedying 
the deficiencies. If the FRB and FDIC ultimately determine that 
we have been unable to remedy the deficiencies, they could order 
us to divest assets or operations in order to facilitate our orderly 
resolution in the event of our material distress or failure. 

We must also prepare and submit to the FRB on an annual 

basis a recovery plan that identifies a range of options that we 
may consider during times of idiosyncratic or systemic economic 
stress to remedy any financial weaknesses and restore market 
confidence without extraordinary government support. Recovery 
options include the possible sale, transfer or disposal of assets, 
securities, loan portfolios or businesses. Our national bank 
subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank N.A., must also prepare and submit 
to the OCC a recovery plan that sets forth the bank’s plan to 
remain a going concern when the bank is experiencing 
considerable financial or operational stress, but has not yet 
deteriorated to the point where liquidation or resolution is 
imminent. If either the FRB or the OCC determine that our 
recovery plan is deficient, they may impose fines or restrictions 
on our business. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our significant accounting policies (see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 
2015 Form 10-K) are fundamental to understanding our results of 
operations and financial condition because they require that we 
use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our 
assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are 
critical because they require management to make difficult, 
subjective and complex judgments about matters that are 
inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially 
different amounts would be reported under different conditions 
or using different assumptions. These policies govern: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

the allowance for credit losses; 
PCI loans; 
the valuation of residential MSRs; 
the fair value of financial instruments; and 
income taxes. 

Management and the Board's Audit and Examination 

Committee have reviewed and approved these critical accounting 
policies. These policies are described further in the “Financial 
Review – Critical Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 
(Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial 
Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 
2016-15 – Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): 
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash 
Payments 

The Update addresses eight specific cash 
flow issues with the objective of reducing 
the existing diversity in practice for 
reporting in the Statement of Cash Flows. 

The Update is effective for us in first quarter 
2018 with retrospective application. We are 
evaluating the impact the Update will have 
on our consolidated financial statements. 

The Update changes the accounting for 
credit losses on loans and debt securities. 
For loans and held-to-maturity debt 
securities, the Update requires a current 
expected credit loss (CECL) approach to 
determine the allowance for credit losses. 
CECL requires loss estimates for the 
remaining estimated life of the financial 
asset using historical experience, current 
conditions, and reasonable and supportable 
forecasts. Also, the Update eliminates the 
existing guidance for PCI loans, but requires 
an allowance for purchased financial assets 
with more than insignificant deterioration 
since origination. In addition, the Update 
modifies the other-than-temporary 
impairment model for available-for-sale debt 
securities to require an allowance for credit 
impairment instead of a direct write-down, 
which allows for reversal of credit 
impairments in future periods based on 
improvements in credit. 

The Update simplifies the accounting for 
share-based payment awards issued to 
employees, including recognition of excess 
tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the 
statement of income instead of within 
additional paid-in capital, and changes to 
classification in the statement of cash flows. 

The Update eliminates the requirement for 
companies to retroactively apply the equity 
method of accounting for investments when 
increases in ownership interests or degree of 
influence result in the adoption of the equity 
method. Under the new guidance, the equity 
method should be applied prospectively in 
the period in which the ownership changes 
occur. 

The Update clarifies the criteria entities 
should use when evaluating whether 
embedded contingent put and call options in 
debt instruments should be separated from 
the debt instrument and accounted for 
separately as derivatives. The Update 
clarifies that companies should not consider 
whether the event that triggers the ability to 
exercise put or call options is related to 
interest rates or credit risk. 

The Update clarifies that a change in the 
counterparty to a derivative instrument that 
has been designated as an accounting hedge 
does not require the hedging relationship to 
be dedesignated as long as all other hedge 
accounting criteria continue to be met. 

The guidance is effective for us in first 
quarter 2020 with a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to retained earnings as of the 
beginning of the year of adoption. Early 
adoption is permitted beginning in first 
quarter 2019. While we are evaluating the 
impact the Update will have on our 
consolidated financial statements, we expect 
the Update will result in an increase in the 
allowance for credit losses given the change 
to estimated losses for the estimated life of 
the financial asset, including an allowance 
for debt securities. The amount of the 
increase will be impacted by the portfolio 
composition and quality at the adoption date 
as well as economic conditions and forecasts 
at that time. 

We expect to adopt the guidance in first

Description 

ASU 2016-04 – Liabilities – Extinguishments of 
Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of 
Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products 

The Update requires entities to recognize 
breakage for prepaid stored-value card 
liabilities (e.g. gift cards) provided the 
liabilities meet certain criteria. 

ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842) 

ASU 2016-01 – Financial Instruments – Overall 
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 

ASU 2014-09 – Revenue from Contracts With 
Customers (Topic 606) and subsequent related 
Updates 

The Update requires lessees to recognize 
leases on the balance sheet with lease 
liabilities and corresponding right-of-use 
assets based on the present value of lease 
payments. Lessor accounting is largely 
unchanged with lease financings and 
operating lease assets similar to existing 
lease accounting. The Update also eliminates 
leveraged lease accounting but allows 
existing leveraged leases to continue their 
current accounting until maturity or 
termination. 

The Update amends the presentation and 
accounting for certain financial instruments, 
including liabilities measured at fair value 
under the fair value option and equity 
investments. The guidance also updates fair 
value presentation and disclosure 
requirements for financial instruments 
measured at amortized cost. 

The Update modifies the guidance 
companies use to recognize revenue from 
contracts with customers for transfers of 
goods or services and transfers of 
nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts 
are within the scope of other standards. The 
guidance also requires new qualitative and 
quantitative disclosures, including 
information about contract balances and 
performance obligations. 

Effective date and financial statement 

impact 

The guidance is effective for us in first 
quarter 2018 with early adoption permitted. 
The guidance allows us to elect the 
transition method, permitting either a 
modified retrospective application with a 
cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance 
sheet as of the beginning of the adoption 
period or retrospective application to each 
period presented. We are evaluating the 
impact the Update will have on our 
consolidated financial statements. 

The guidance is effective for us in first 
quarter 2019 with modified retrospective 
application. Early adoption is permitted. We 
are evaluating the impact the Update will 
have on our consolidated financial 
statements. 

The Update is effective for us in first quarter 
2018 with prospective application to 
changes in guidance related to 
nonmarketable equity investments. The 
remaining amendments should be applied 
with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the 
balance sheet as of the beginning of the 
adoption period. Early application is only 
permitted for changes related to liabilities 
measured at fair value under the fair value 
option. Early adoption is prohibited for the 
remaining amendments. We are evaluating 
the impact of the Update on our 
consolidated financial statements. 

 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 
2015-14 (Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the 
Effective Date), which defers the effective 
date of ASU 2014-09 to first quarter 2018. 
Early adoption is permitted in first quarter 
2017. Our revenue is balanced between net 
interest income on financial assets and 
liabilities, which is explicitly excluded from 
the scope of the new guidance, and 
noninterest income. We continue to evaluate 
the impact of the Update to our noninterest 
income and on our presentation and 
disclosures. We expect to adopt the Update 
in first quarter 2018 with a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to opening retained earnings.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This document contains “forward-looking statements” within the 
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our 
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and our 
management may make forward-looking statements orally to 
analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. 
Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as 
“anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” 
“expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” 
“could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. 
In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not 
limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or 
financial performance of the Company, including our outlook for 
future growth; (ii) our noninterest expense and efficiency ratio; 
(iii) future credit quality and performance, including our 
expectations regarding future loan losses and allowance levels; 
(iv) the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses; (v) our 
expectations regarding net interest income and net interest 
margin; (vi) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in 
our loan portfolios; (vii) future capital levels or targets and our 
estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III capital 
standards; (viii) the performance of our mortgage business and 
any related exposures; (ix) the expected outcome and impact of 
legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our 
expectations regarding compliance therewith; (x) future common 
stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of 
capital; (xi) our targeted range for return on assets and return on 
equity; (xii) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal 
proceedings; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and 
strategies. 

Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts 
but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions 
regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. 
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are 
subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in 
circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may 
differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking 
statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of 
these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of 
historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future 
performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks 
and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors 
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in 
the forward-looking statements include the following, without 
limitation: 
• 	

current and future economic and market conditions, 
including the effects of declines in housing prices, high 
unemployment rates, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax 
matters, geopolitical matters, and the overall slowdown in 
global economic growth; 
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under 
regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital 
standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or 
raise capital on favorable terms; 
financial services reform and other current, pending or 
future legislation or regulation that could have a negative 
effect on our revenue and businesses, including the Dodd-
Frank Act and other legislation and regulation relating to 
bank products and services; 
the extent of our success in our loan modification efforts, as 
well as the effects of regulatory requirements or guidance 
regarding loan modifications; 

• 	

• 	

• 	

66 

the amount of mortgage loan repurchase demands that we 
receive and our ability to satisfy any such demands without 
having to repurchase loans related thereto or otherwise 
indemnify or reimburse third parties, and the credit quality 
of or losses on such repurchased mortgage loans; 
negative effects relating to our mortgage servicing and 
foreclosure practices, as well as changes in industry 
standards or practices, regulatory or judicial requirements, 
penalties or fines, increased servicing and other costs or 
obligations, including loan modification requirements, or 
delays or moratoriums on foreclosures; 
our ability to realize our efficiency ratio target as part of our 
expense management initiatives, including as a result of 
business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in 
our business composition and operating environment, 
growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and 
unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, 
litigation and regulatory matters; 
the effect of the current low interest rate environment or 
changes in interest rates on our net interest income, net 
interest margin and our mortgage originations, mortgage 
servicing rights and mortgages held for sale; 
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or 
financial markets, which could result in, among other things, 
reduced investor demand for mortgage loans, a reduction in 
the availability of funding or increased funding costs, and 
declines in asset values and/or recognition of other-than­
temporary impairment on securities held in our investment 
securities portfolio; 
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment 
banking business and our fee income from our brokerage, 
asset and wealth management businesses; 
negative effects from the retail banking sales practices 
matter, including on our legal, operational and compliance 
costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or 
offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and 
attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified 
team members, and our reputation; 
reputational damage from negative publicity, protests, fines, 
penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory 
violations and legal actions; 
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems 
or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors or other 
service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks; 
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings 
account deposits on our funding costs and net interest 
margin; 
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 
and 
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under 
“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2015.

In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the 
amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or 
repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and 
financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital 
requirements (including under Basel capital standards), common 
stock issuance requirements, applicable law and regulations 
(including federal securities laws and federal banking 
regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s 

Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of 

the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause 
our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it 
is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no 
obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, 
whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, except as may be required by law. 

Board of Directors, and may be subject to regulatory approval or 
conditions. 

For more information about factors that could cause actual 

results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our 
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual 
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available 
on its website at www.sec.gov. 

Risk Factors 

An investment in the Company involves risk, including the 
possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially 
and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could 
be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that 
could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the 
value of, and return on, an investment in the Company, we refer 
you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2015 Form 10-K. The 
following risk factor updates the risk factors described in our 
2015 Form 10-K: 

Risks Related to Sales Practices.  Various government 
entities and offices, as well as Congressional committees, have 
undertaken formal or informal inquiries, investigations or 
examinations arising out of certain sales practices of the 
Company that were the subject of settlements with the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney 
announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. In addition to 
imposing monetary penalties and other sanctions, regulatory 
authorities may require admissions of wrongdoing and 
compliance with other conditions in connection with such 
matters, which can lead to restrictions on our ability to engage in 
certain business activities or offer certain products or services, 
limitations on our ability to access capital markets, limitations on 
capital distributions, the loss of customers, and/or other direct 
and indirect adverse consequences. A number of lawsuits have 
also been filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages or 
other remedies related to these sales practices. The ultimate 
resolution of any of these pending legal proceedings or 
government investigations, depending on the sanctions and 
remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our 
results of operations and financial condition. We may also incur 
additional costs and expenses in order to address and defend 
these pending legal proceedings and government investigations, 
and we may have increased compliance and other costs related to 
these matters. Furthermore, negative publicity or public opinion 
resulting from these matters may increase the risk of reputational 
harm to our business, which can impact our ability to keep and 
attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified team 
members, result in the loss of revenue, or have other material 
adverse effects on our results of operations and financial 
condition.

Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2016, of the Company’s disclosure controls and 
procedures. The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the 
Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process 
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the 
Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting 
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that: 
• 	

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of 
assets of the Company; 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the Company; and 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the 
Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

• 	

• 	

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of 

any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during third quarter 
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 

Wells Fargo & Company is a diversified financial services 
company. We provide banking, insurance, trust and investments, 
mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, 
brokerage, and consumer and commercial finance through 
branches, the internet and other distribution channels to 
consumers, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, and in foreign countries. When we refer to 
“Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean 
Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). 
Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding 
company and a bank holding company. We also hold a majority 
interest in a real estate investment trust, which has publicly 
traded preferred stock outstanding. 

Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. 

generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in 
the financial services industry. For discussion of our significant 
accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 2015 (2015 Form 10-K). There were no 
material changes to these policies in the first nine months of 
2016. To prepare the financial statements in conformity with 
GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions 
about future economic and market conditions (for example, 
unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the financial statements, income and expenses during the 
reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our 
estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect 
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual 
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, 
which could materially affect our results of operations and 
financial condition. Management has made significant estimates 
in several areas, including allowance for credit losses and 
purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans (Note 5 (Loans and 
Allowance for Credit Losses)), valuations of residential mortgage 
servicing rights (MSRs) (Note 7 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) and Note 8 (Mortgage Banking Activities)) and 
financial instruments (Note 13 (Fair Values of Assets and 
Liabilities)), and income taxes. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates. 

These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all 

adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary 
for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. These 
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise 
disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations in the 
interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the 
results that may be expected for the full year. The interim 
financial information should be read in conjunction with our 
2015 Form 10-K. 

 

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2016 
In first quarter 2016, we adopted the following new accounting 
guidance: 

• 	

Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2015-16 – 
 
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the 
Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments; 

• 	

• 	

• 	

• 	

• 	

• 	

• 	

 

ASU 2015-07 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): 
 
Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that 
Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent); 
ASU 2015-03 – Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 
835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance 
Costs; 
ASU 2015-02 – Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to 
the Consolidation Analysis; 
ASU 2015-01 – Income Statement – Extraordinary and 
Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income 
Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of 
Extraordinary Items; 
ASU 2014-16 – Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): 
Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid 
Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More 
Akin to Debt or to Equity; 
ASU 2014-13 – Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the 
Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a 
Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity; and 
ASU 2014-12 – Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 
718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the 
Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target 
Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. 

ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement for companies to 
retrospectively adjust initial amounts recognized in business 
combinations when the accounting is incomplete at the 
acquisition date. Under the new guidance, companies should 
record adjustments in the same reporting period in which the 
amounts are determined. We adopted this accounting change in 
first quarter 2016 with prospective application. The Update did 
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements. 

ASU 2015-07 eliminates the disclosure requirement to 
categorize investments within the fair value hierarchy that are 
measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical 
expedient. We adopted this change in first quarter 2016 with 
retrospective application. The Update did not affect our 
consolidated financial statements as it impacts only the fair value 
disclosure requirements for certain investments. For additional 
information, see Note 13 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities). 

ASU 2015-03 changes the balance sheet presentation for debt 
issuance costs. Under the new guidance, debt issuance costs 
should be reported as a deduction from debt liabilities rather 
than as a deferred charge classified as an asset. We adopted this 
 
change in first quarter 2016, which resulted in a $180 million 
reclassification from Other assets to Long-term debt on January 
1, 2016. Because the impact on prior periods was not material, we 
applied the guidance prospectively. 

ASU 2015-02 requires companies to reevaluate all legal entities 
under new consolidation guidance. The new guidance amends the 
criteria companies use to evaluate whether they should 
consolidate certain variable interest entities that have fee 
arrangements and the criteria used to determine whether 
partnerships and similar entities are variable interest entities. 
The new guidance also amends the consolidation analysis for 
certain investment funds and excludes certain money market 

75 

Notes 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

funds. We adopted the accounting changes on January 1, 2016, 
which resulted in a net increase in assets and a corresponding 
cumulative-effect adjustment to noncontrolling interests of $121 
million. There was no impact to consolidated retained earnings. 
For additional information, see Note 7 (Securitizations and 
Variable Interest Entities). 

ASU 2015-01 removes the concept of extraordinary items from 
GAAP and eliminates the requirement for extraordinary items to 
be separately presented in the statement of income. We adopted 
this change in first quarter 2016 with prospective application. 
This Update did not have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements. 

ASU 2014-16 clarifies that the nature of host contracts in hybrid 
financial instruments that are issued in share form should be 
determined based on the entire instrument, including the 
embedded derivative. We adopted this new requirement in first 
quarter 2016. This Update did not have a material impact on our 
consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-13 provides a measurement alternative to companies 
that consolidate collateralized financing entities (CFEs), such as 
collateralized debt obligation and collateralized loan obligation 
structures. Under the new guidance, companies can measure 
both the financial assets and financial liabilities of a CFE using 
the more observable fair value of the financial assets or of the 
financial liabilities. We adopted this accounting change in first 
quarter 2016. The Update did not have a material impact on our 
consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-12 provides accounting guidance for employee share-
based payment awards with specific performance targets. The 
Update clarifies that performance targets should be treated as 
performance conditions if the targets affect vesting and could be 
achieved after the requisite service period. We adopted this 
change in first quarter 2016 with prospective application. The 
Update did not have a material effect on our consolidated 
financial statements, as our historical practice complies with the 
new requirements. 

Accounting Standards with Retrospective 
Application 
The following accounting pronouncement has been issued by the 
FASB but is not yet effective: 

• 	

ASU 2016-15 – Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): 
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. 

ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the 
objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice for 
reporting in the Statement of Cash Flows. The Update is effective 
for us in first quarter 2018 with retrospective application. We are 
evaluating the impact the Update will have on our consolidated 
financial statements. 

 

Private Share Repurchases 
From time to time we enter into private forward repurchase 
transactions with unrelated third parties to complement our 
open-market common stock repurchase strategies, to allow us to 
manage our share repurchases in a manner consistent with our 
capital plans submitted annually under the Comprehensive 
Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and to provide an economic 
benefit to the Company. 

Our payments to the counterparties for these contracts are 

recorded in permanent equity in the quarter paid and are not 
subject to re-measurement. The classification of the up-front 
payments as permanent equity assures that we have appropriate 
repurchase timing consistent with our capital plans, which 
contemplate a fixed dollar amount available per quarter for share 
repurchases pursuant to Federal Reserve Board (FRB) 
supervisory guidance. In return, the counterparty agrees to 
deliver a variable number of shares based on a per share discount 
to the volume-weighted average stock price over the contract 
period. There are no scenarios where the contracts would not 
either physically settle in shares or allow us to choose the 
settlement method. Our total number of outstanding shares of 
common stock is not reduced until settlement of the private share 
repurchase contract. 

We had no unsettled private share repurchase contracts at 

both September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  We have evaluated the effects of events 
that have occurred subsequent to September 30, 2016, and there 
have been no material events that would require recognition in 
our third quarter 2016 consolidated financial statements or 
disclosure in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
During the first week of October 2016, Hurricane Matthew 
caused destruction along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South 
Carolina and North Carolina and resulted in, among other things, 
property damage for our customers and the closing of many 
businesses. We are currently assessing the impact to our 
customers and our business as a result of Hurricane Matthew. 
The financial impact to us is expected to primarily relate to our 
consumer real estate, commercial real estate and auto loan 
portfolios and will depend on a number of factors, including the 
types of loans most affected by the hurricane, the extent of 
damage to our collateral, the extent of available insurance 
coverage, the availability of government assistance for our 
borrowers, and whether our borrowers’ ability to repay their 
loans has been diminished.

Note 2:  Business Combinations 

 

We regularly explore opportunities to acquire financial services 
companies and businesses. Generally, we do not make a public 
announcement about an acquisition opportunity until a definitive 
agreement has been signed. For information on additional 
contingent consideration related to acquisitions, which is 
considered to be a guarantee, see Note 10 (Guarantees, Pledged 
Assets and Collateral). We also periodically review existing 
businesses to ensure they remain strategically aligned with our 
operating business model and risk profile. 

During the first nine months of 2016, we completed two 
 

acquisitions and refined the related purchase accounting 
adjustments. On January 1, 2016, we acquired $4.3 billion in 
assets associated with GE Railcar Services, which included 
77,000 railcars and 1,000 locomotives. The acquired assets 
included $918 million of loans and capital leases and $3.2 billion 
 
of operating lease assets. 

On March 1, 2016, we acquired the North American portion 

of GE Capital’s Commercial Distribution Finance and Vendor 
Finance businesses. The North American portion represented 
approximately 90% of the total assets to be acquired. The Asia, 
Australia and New Zealand portions closed during third quarter 
2016 and the remainder of the international portion closed on 

October 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, and reflective of 
purchase accounting adjustment refinements, a total of 
$31.1 billion in assets have been acquired, including $25.6 billion 
 
of loans and capital leases, $2.7 billion of operating lease assets, 
and $1.8 billion of goodwill and intangible assets. The 
international portion that closed on October 1, 2016, completed 
the overall acquisition and consisted of an additional $1.3 billion 
 
in acquired assets. 

We also completed two significant and a few small 

divestitures during the first nine months of 2016. On March 31, 
2016, we completed the divestiture of Rural Community 
Insurance, our crop insurance business. The transaction resulted 
in a pre-tax gain of $381 million. On May 31, 2016, we sold our 
health benefit services business, which resulted in a pre-tax gain 
of $290 million. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had one pending acquisition 

involving a registered investment advisor with approximately 
$15 billion in assets under management. We closed the 
acquisition on October 1, 2016.

Short-Term Investments 

Table 3.1 provides the detail of federal funds sold, securities 
purchased under short-term resale agreements (generally less 
than one year) and other short-term investments. Substantially 
all of the interest-earning deposits at September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015, were held at the Federal Reserve.

As part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing 
organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity 
meant to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen 
events occur or are deemed likely to occur. This includes 
commitments we have entered into to purchase securities under 
resale agreements from a central clearing organization that, at its 
option, require us to provide funding under such agreements. We 
do not have any outstanding amounts funded, and the amount of 
our unfunded contractual commitment was $3.3 billion and 
$2.2 billion as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 
respectively. 

We have classified securities purchased under long-term 
resale agreements (generally one year or more), which totaled 
$21.2 billion and $20.1 billion at September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015, respectively, in loans. For additional 
information on the collateral we receive from other entities under 
resale agreements and securities borrowings, see the “Offsetting 
of Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowing 
and Lending Agreements” section in Note 10 (Guarantees, 
Pledged Assets and Collateral).

Note 4:  Investment Securities 

Table 4.1 provides the amortized cost and fair value by major 
categories of available-for-sale securities, which are carried at fair 
value, and held-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at 

amortized cost. The net unrealized gains (losses) for available-
for-sale securities are reported on an after-tax basis as a 
component of cumulative OCI.

We have assessed each security with gross unrealized losses 

included in the previous table for credit impairment. As part of 
that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not 
intend to sell any of the securities and that it is more likely than 
not that we will not be required to sell prior to recovery of the 
amortized cost basis. For debt securities, we evaluate, where 
necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the 
present value of the expected cash flows to the securities’ 
amortized cost basis. For equity securities, we consider numerous 
factors in determining whether impairment exists, including our 
intent and ability to hold the securities for a period of time 
sufficient to recover the cost basis of the securities. 

For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing 

securities for impairment, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies) and Note 5 (Investment Securities) to 
Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. There were no 
material changes to our methodologies for assessing impairment 
in the first nine months of 2016. 

Table 4.3 shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of 
debt and perpetual preferred investment securities by those rated 
investment grade and those rated less than investment grade, 

according to their lowest credit rating by Standard & Poor’s 
Rating Services (S&P) or Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). 
Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a 
security. Securities rated investment grade, that is those rated 
BBB- or higher by S&P or Baa3 or higher by Moody’s, are 
generally considered by the rating agencies and market 
participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, securities rated 
below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by the 
rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit 
risk than investment grade securities. We have also included 
securities not rated by S&P or Moody’s in the table below based 
on our internal credit grade of the securities (used for credit risk 
management purposes) equivalent to the credit rating assigned 
by major credit agencies. The unrealized losses and fair value of 
unrated securities categorized as investment grade based on 
internal credit grades were $63 million and $4.0 billion, 
respectively, at September 30, 2016, and $17 million and $3.7 
billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015. If an internal credit 
grade was not assigned, we categorized the security as non-
investment grade.

Table 4.4 shows the remaining contractual maturities and 
contractual weighted-average yields (taxable-equivalent basis) of 
available-for-sale debt securities. The remaining contractual 
principal maturities for MBS do not consider 

prepayments. Remaining expected maturities will differ from 
contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to 
prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature.

Loan Purchases, Sales, and Transfers 
Table 5.3 summarizes the proceeds paid or received for purchases 
and sales of loans and transfers from loans held for investment to 
mortgages/loans held for sale at lower of cost or fair value. This 
loan activity also includes participating interests, whereby we

receive or transfer a portion of a loan. The table excludes PCI 
loans and loans for which we have elected the fair value option, 
including loans originated for sale because their loan activity 
normally does not impact the allowance for credit losses.

(1) 	 Purchases include loans and capital leases from the GE Capital business acquisitions as described in Note 2 (Business Combinations). 
(2) 	 Excludes activity in government insured/guaranteed real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans. As servicer, we are able to buy delinquent insured/guaranteed loans out of 
the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pools, and manage and/or resell them in accordance with applicable requirements. These loans are predominantly 
insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Accordingly, these loans have limited impact on the 
allowance for loan losses. 

Commitments to Lend 
A commitment to lend is a legally binding agreement to lend 
funds to a customer, usually at a stated interest rate, if funded, 
and for specific purposes and time periods. We generally require 
a fee to extend such commitments. Certain commitments are 
subject to loan agreements with covenants regarding the financial 
performance of the customer or borrowing base formulas on an 
ongoing basis that must be met before we are required to fund 
the commitment. We may reduce or cancel consumer 
commitments, including home equity lines and credit card lines, 
in accordance with the contracts and applicable law. 

We may, as a representative for other lenders, advance funds 

or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated 
loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally 
repaid in less than a week and would normally require default of 
both the customer and another lender to expose us to loss. These 
temporary advance arrangements totaled approximately $75 
billion at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

We issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in 
purchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At 
both September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had $1.1 
billion of outstanding issued commercial letters of credit. We also 
originate multipurpose lending commitments under which 
borrowers have the option to draw on the facility for different 
purposes in one of several forms, including a standby letter of 
credit. See Note 10 (Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral) 
for additional information on standby letters of credit. 

When we make commitments, we are exposed to credit risk. 

The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally 
be lower than the contractual amount because a significant 
portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being 
used by the customer. In addition, we manage the potential risk 
in commitments to lend by limiting the total amount of 
commitments, both by individual customer and in total, by 
monitoring the size and maturity structure of these commitments 
and by applying the same credit standards for these 
commitments as for all of our credit activities. 

For loans and commitments to lend, we generally require 

collateral or a guarantee. We may require various types of 
collateral, including commercial and consumer real estate, 

automobiles, other short-term liquid assets such as accounts 
receivable or inventory and long-lived assets, such as equipment 
and other business assets. Collateral requirements for each loan 
or commitment may vary based on the loan product and our 
assessment of a customer’s credit risk according to the specific 
credit underwriting, including credit terms and structure. 

The contractual amount of our unfunded credit 

commitments, including unissued standby and commercial 
letters of credit, is summarized by portfolio segment and class of 
financing receivable in Table 5.4. The table excludes the standby 
and commercial letters of credit and temporary advance 
arrangements described above.

pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 regarding allowance for non-impaired loans. 

(2) 	 Represents loans individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivables (formerly FAS 114), and pursuant to amendments by ASU 2010-20 

regarding allowance for impaired loans.

Credit Quality 
We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and 
utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness 
of the allowance for credit losses. The following sections provide 
the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit 
quality indicators are generally based on information as of our 
financial statement date, with the exception of updated Fair Isaac 
Corporation (FICO) scores and updated loan-to-value (LTV)/ 

combined LTV (CLTV).We obtain FICO scores at loan origination 
and the scores are generally updated at least quarterly, except in 
limited circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA). Generally, the LTV and CLTV indicators 
are updated in the second month of each quarter, with updates 
no older than June 30, 2016. See the “Purchased Credit-Impaired 
Loans” section in this Note for credit quality information on our 
PCI portfolio. 

89 

Note 5:  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

 

COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  In addition to 
monitoring commercial loan concentration risk, we manage a 
consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. 
Generally, commercial loans are subject to individual risk 
assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality 
ratings. Our ratings are aligned to Pass and Criticized categories. 
The Criticized category includes Special Mention, Substandard, 
and Doubtful categories which are defined by bank regulatory 
agencies. 

 
Table 5.8:  Commercial Loans by Risk Category 

  

Table 5.8 provides a breakdown of outstanding commercial 

loans by risk category. Of the $22.3 billion in criticized 
commercial and industrial loans and $6.0 billion in criticized 
commercial real estate (CRE) loans at September 30, 2016, $3.3 
billion and $839 million, respectively, have been placed on 
nonaccrual status and written down to net realizable collateral 
value.

CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS  We have various 
classes of consumer loans that present unique risks. Loan 
delinquency, FICO credit scores and LTV for loan types are 
common credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in 
our evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit 
losses for the consumer portfolio segment. 

  

Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the 

allowance for credit losses rely on delinquency-based models; 
therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality 
and the establishment of our allowance for credit losses. Table 
5.10 provides the outstanding balances of our consumer portfolio 
by delinquency status.

$9.8 billion at September 30, 2016, compared with $12.4 billion at December 31, 2015. 

Of the $3.7 billion of consumer loans not government 

insured/guaranteed that are 90 days or more past due at 
September 30, 2016, $802 million was accruing, compared with 
$5.5 billion past due and $867 million accruing at December 31, 
2015. 

Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans 180 days or more 

past due totaled $1.9 billion, or 0.7% of total first mortgages 
(excluding PCI), at September 30, 2016, compared with $3.4 
billion, or 1.3%, at December 31, 2015. 

 

 

Table 5.11 provides a breakdown of our consumer portfolio 
by FICO. Most of the scored consumer portfolio has an updated 
FICO of 680 and above, reflecting a strong current borrower 
credit profile. FICO is not available for certain loan types and 
may not be obtained if we deem it unnecessary due to strong 
collateral and other borrower attributes, substantially all of which 
are security-based loans originated through retail brokerage of 
$7.6 billion at September 30, 2016, and $7.0 billion at 
December 31, 2015.

(1)  Represents loans whose repayments are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. 

 
LTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s unpaid principal 

balance to the property’s collateral value. CLTV refers to the 
combination of first mortgage and junior lien mortgage 
(including unused line amounts for credit line products) ratios. 
LTVs and CLTVs are updated quarterly using a cascade approach 
which first uses values provided by automated valuation models 
(AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the 
value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by 
the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. 
If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. 
The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high 
value properties, generally with an original value of $1 million or 
more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these 
properties. 

Table 5.12 shows the most updated LTV and CLTV 

distribution of the real estate 1-4 family first and junior lien 
mortgage loan portfolios. We consider the trends in residential 
real estate markets as we monitor credit risk and establish our 
allowance for credit losses. In the event of a default, any loss 
should be limited to the portion of the loan amount in excess of 
the net realizable value of the underlying real estate collateral 
value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV due to industry 
data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other 
institutions.

LOANS IN PROCESS OF FORECLOSURE  Our recorded 
investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by 
residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure 
was $8.5 billion and $11.0 billion at September 30, 2016 and 
December 31, 2015, respectively, which included $5.0 billion and 
$6.2 billion, respectively, of loans that are government insured/ 
guaranteed. We commence the foreclosure process on consumer 
real estate loans when a borrower becomes 120 days delinquent 
in accordance with Consumer Finance Protection Bureau 
Guidelines. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending 
on whether the property address resides in a judicial or non-
judicial state. Judicial states require the foreclosure to be 
processed through the state’s courts while non-judicial states are 
processed without court intervention. Foreclosure timelines var
y
according to state law. 

93 

Note 5:  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

  
LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING 
Certain loans 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal 
are still accruing, because they are (1) well-secured and in the 
process of collection or (2) real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans 
or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being 
classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days 
past due. PCI loans of $2.2 billion at September 30, 2016, and 
$2.9 billion at December 31, 2015, are not included in these past 
due and still accruing loans even though they are 90 days or more 
contractually past due. These PCI loans are considered to be 
accruing because they continue to earn interest from accretable 
yield, independent of performance in accordance with their 
contractual terms. 

 

Table 5.14 shows non-PCI loans 90 days or more past due 

and still accruing by class for loans not government insured/

IMPAIRED LOANS  Table 5.15 summarizes key information for 
impaired loans. Our impaired loans predominantly include loans 
on nonaccrual status in the commercial portfolio segment and 
loans modified in a TDR, whether on accrual or nonaccrual 
status. These impaired loans generally have estimated losses 
which are included in the allowance for credit losses. We have 
impaired loans with no allowance for credit losses when loss 
content has been previously recognized through charge-offs and 
we do not anticipate additional charge-offs or losses, or certain 

 
Table 5.15:  Impaired Loans Summary 

  

loans are currently performing in accordance with their terms 
and for which no loss has been estimated. Impaired loans exclude 
PCI loans. Table 5.15 includes trial modifications that totaled 
$348 million at September 30, 2016, and $402 million at 
December 31, 2015. 

For additional information on our impaired loans and 

allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant

Includes interest recognized on accruing TDRs, interest recognized related to certain impaired loans which have an allowance calculated using discounting, and amortization 
of purchase accounting adjustments related to certain impaired loans. 

TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)  When, for 
economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial 
difficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant 
period of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise 
consider, the related loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of 
which totaled $21.5 billion and $22.7 billion at September 30, 
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We do not consider 
any loans modified through a loan resolution such as foreclosure 
or short sale to be a TDR. 

We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing 

financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period 
of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned 
permanent modification, to determine if they can perform 
according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial 
modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While 
loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not 
considered modified and they continue to advance through 
delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original 
terms. The planned modifications for these arrangements 
primarily involve interest rate reductions; however, the exact 
concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not 
finalized and do not take effect until the loan is permanently 
modified. The trial period terms are developed in accordance 
with our proprietary programs or the U.S. Treasury’s Making 
Home Affordable programs for real estate 1-4 family first lien (i.e. 
Home Affordable Modification Program – HAMP) and junior lien 
(i.e. Second Lien Modification Program – 2MP) mortgage loans. 

96 

At September 30, 2016, the loans in trial modification period 

were $146 million under HAMP, $28 million under 2MP and 
$174 million under proprietary programs, compared with 
$130 million, $32 million and $240 million at December 31, 
2015, respectively. Trial modifications with a recorded 
investment of $125 million at September 30, 2016, and $136 
million at December 31, 2015, were accruing loans and $223 
million and $266 million, respectively, were nonaccruing loans. 
Our experience is that most of the mortgages that enter a trial 
payment period program are successful in completing the 
program requirements and are then permanently modified at the 
end of the trial period. Our allowance process considers the 
impact of those modifications that are probable to occur. 

Table 5.17 summarizes our TDR modifications for the 

periods presented by primary modification type and includes the 
financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that 
modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that 
occurred during the period. Loans that both modify and pay off 
within the period, as well as changes in recorded investment 
during the period for loans modified in prior periods, are not 
included in the table.

(1) 	 Amounts represent the recorded investment in loans after recognizing the effects of the TDR, if any. TDRs may have multiple types of concessions, but are presented only 

once in the first modification type based on the order presented in the table above. The reported amounts include loans remodified of $484 million and $369 million, for 
quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(2) 	 Principal modifications include principal forgiveness at the time of the modification, contingent principal forgiveness granted over the life of the loan based on borrower 

performance, and principal that has been legally separated and deferred to the end of the loan, with a zero percent contractual interest rate. 

(3) 	 Other concessions include loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but exclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or 

reduce the contractual interest rate. 

(4) 	 Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if 
the loan has been charged down prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal 
modification. Modifications resulted in legally forgiving principal (actual, contingent or deferred) of $16 million and $32 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 
 
and 2015, and $54 million and $78 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(5) 	 Reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans reported as a principal primary 

modification type that also have an interest rate concession. 

(6) 	 Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through 

delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; 
however, the exact concession type and resulting financial effect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are 
presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the current period. 

98 

Table 5.18 summarizes permanent modification TDRs that 

have defaulted in the current period within 12 months of their 
permanent modification date. We are reporting these defaulted 
TDRs based on a payment default definition of 90 days past due 
for the commercial portfolio segment and 60 days past due for 
the consumer portfolio segment.

Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans 
Substantially all of our PCI loans were acquired from Wachovia 
on December 31, 2008, at which time we acquired commercial 
and consumer loans with a carrying value of $18.7 billion and 
$40.1 billion, respectively. The unpaid principal balance on 
December 31, 2008 was $98.2 billion for the total of commercial 
and consumer PCI loans. Table 5.19 presents PCI loans net of any 
remaining purchase accounting adjustments. Commercial and 
industrial PCI loans at September 30, 2016, included $290 
million from the GE Capital business acquisitions. Real estate 1-4 
family first mortgage PCI loans are predominantly Pick-a-Pay 
loans.

Note 5:  Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses (continued) 

 

ACCRETABLE YIELD The excess of cash flows expected to be 
collected over the carrying value of PCI loans is referred to as the 
accretable yield and is recognized in interest income using an 
effective yield method over the remaining life of the loan, or pools 
of loans. The accretable yield is affected by: 
• 	

changes in interest rate indices for variable rate PCI loans – 
expected future cash flows are based on the variable rates in 
effect at the time of the regular evaluations of cash flows 
expected to be collected; 
changes in prepayment assumptions – prepayments affect 
the estimated life of PCI loans which may change the amount 
of interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be 
collected; and 
changes in the expected principal and interest payments over 
the estimated weighted-average life – updates to expected 

• 	

• 	

cash flows are driven by the credit outlook and actions taken 
with borrowers. Changes in expected future cash flows from 
loan modifications are included in the regular evaluations of 
cash flows expected to be collected. 

 

The change in the accretable yield related to PCI loans since 

the merger with Wachovia is presented in Table 5.20. Changes 
during third quarter 2016 reflect an expectation, as a result of our 
quarterly evaluation of PCI cash flows, that prepayment of 
modified Pick-a-Pay loans will significantly increase over their 
estimated weighted-average life and that expected loss has 
decreased as a result of reduced loan to value ratios and 
sustained higher housing prices.

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Investments  We invest 
in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low income 
housing tax credit (LIHTC), which is designed to promote private 
development of low income housing. These investments generate 
a return mostly through realization of federal tax credits. 

Total LIHTC investments were $9.2 billion and $8.3 billion 
 
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In 
third quarter and first nine months of 2016, we recognized pre­
tax losses of $199 million and $600 million, respectively, related 
to our LIHTC investments, compared with $173 million and $529 
million, respectively, for the same periods a year ago. We also 
recognized total tax benefits of $308 million and $919 million in 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, which included 
tax credits recorded in income taxes of $233 million and $693 
million for the same periods, respectively. In the third quarter 
and first nine months of 2015, total tax benefits were $269 
million and $819 million, respectively, which included tax credits 
of $203 million and $619 million for the same periods, 
respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional 
financial support during the investment period. Our liability for 
these unfunded commitments was $3.4 billion at September 30, 
2016 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2015. Predominantly all of 
this liability is expected to be paid over the next three years. This 
liability is included in long-term debt. 

(1) 	 Represents low income housing tax credit investments. 
(2) 	 Represents nonmarketable equity investments for which we have elected the 

fair value option. See Note 13 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for 
additional information. 

(3) 	 Certain government-guaranteed residential real estate mortgage loans upon 

foreclosure are included in Accounts receivable. Both principal and interest 
related to these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans 
were predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. For more 
information on ASU 2014-14 and the classification of certain government-
guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2015 10-K. 
Includes derivatives designated as hedging instruments, derivatives not 
designated as hedging instruments, and derivative loan commitments, which 
are carried at fair value. See Note 12 (Derivatives) for additional information.

Note 7:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities 

Involvement with SPEs 
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of 
on- and off-balance sheet transactions with SPEs, which are 
corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships 
that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are 
formed in connection with securitization transactions and are 
considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For further 
description of our involvement with SPEs, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

We have segregated our involvement with VIEs between 

those VIEs which we consolidate, those which we do not 
consolidate and those for which we account for the transfers of 
financial assets as secured borrowings. Secured borrowings are 
transactions involving transfers of our financial assets to third 
parties that are accounted for as financings with the assets 
pledged as collateral. Accordingly, the transferred assets remain 
recognized on our balance sheet. Subsequent tables within this 
Note further segregate these transactions by structure type. 

Table 7.1 provides the classifications of assets and liabilities 

in our balance sheet for our transactions with VIEs.

do not 
consolidate

(1) 	 Excludes certain debt securities related to loans serviced for the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and

Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs 
Our transactions with unconsolidated VIEs include 
securitizations of residential mortgage loans, CRE loans, student 
loans, automobile loans and leases, certain dealer floorplan 
loans; investment and financing activities involving collateralized 
debt obligations (CDOs) backed by asset-backed and CRE 
104 

securities, tax credit structures, collateralized loan obligations 
(CLOs) backed by corporate loans, and other types of structured 
financing. We have various forms of involvement with VIEs, 
including servicing, holding senior or subordinated interests, 
entering into liquidity arrangements, credit default swaps and 
other derivative contracts. Involvements with these 

unconsolidated VIEs are recorded on our balance sheet in trading 
assets, investment securities, loans, MSRs, other assets, other 
liabilities, and long-term debt, as appropriate. 

Table 7.2 provides a summary of unconsolidated VIEs with 

which we have significant continuing involvement, but we are not 
the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our continuing 
involvement in an unconsolidated VIE to be significant when it 
relates to third-party sponsored VIEs for which we were not the 
transferor (unless we are servicer and have other significant 
forms of involvement) or if we were the sponsor only or sponsor 
and servicer but do not have any other forms of significant 
involvement. 

Significant continuing involvement includes transactions 

where we were the sponsor or transferor and have other 
significant forms of involvement. Sponsorship includes 
transactions with unconsolidated VIEs where we solely or 
materially participated in the initial design or structuring of the 

 
Table 7.2:  Unconsolidated VIEs 

  

entity or marketing of the transaction to investors. When we 
transfer assets to a VIE and account for the transfer as a sale, we 
are considered the transferor. We consider investments in 
securities (other than those held temporarily in trading), loans, 
guarantees, liquidity agreements, written options and servicing of 
collateral to be other forms of involvement that may be 
significant. We have excluded certain transactions with 
unconsolidated VIEs from the balances presented in the 
following table where we have determined that our continuing 
involvement is not significant due to the temporary nature and 
size of our variable interests, because we were not the transferor 
or because we were not involved in the design of the 
unconsolidated VIEs. We also exclude from the table secured 
borrowing transactions with unconsolidated VIEs (for 
information on these transactions, see the Transactions with 
Consolidated VIEs and Secured Borrowings section in this Note).

Includes total equity interests of $9.8 billion and $8.9 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. Also includes debt interests in the form of both 
loans and securities. Excludes certain debt securities held related to loans serviced for FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA. 

(2) 	 Excludes assets and related liabilities with a recorded carrying value on our balance sheet of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 
respectively, for certain delinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. The recorded carrying value represents the amount that would be 
payable if the Company was to exercise the repurchase option. The carrying amounts are excluded from the table because the loans eligible for repurchase do not 
represent interests in the VIEs. 

(3) 	 Represents senior loans to trusts that are collateralized by asset-backed securities. The trusts invest predominantly in senior tranches from a diversified pool of U.S. asset 

securitizations, of which all are current and 100% and 70% were rated as investment grade by the primary rating agencies at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 
2015, respectively. These senior loans are accounted for at amortized cost and are subject to the Company’s allowance and credit charge-off policies. 
Includes structured financing and credit-linked note structures. Also contains investments in auction rate securities (ARS) issued by VIEs that we do not sponsor and, 
accordingly, are unable to obtain the total assets of the entity.

TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES  VIEs that we wholly own 
issue debt securities or preferred equity to third party investors. 
All of the proceeds of the issuance are invested in debt securities 
or preferred equity that we issue to the VIEs. The VIEs’ 
operations and cash flows relate only to the issuance, 
administration and repayment of the securities held by third 
parties. We do not consolidate these VIEs because the sole assets 
of the VIEs are receivables from us, even though we own all of the 
voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the 
obligations of the VIEs and may have the right to redeem the 
third party securities under certain circumstances. In our 
consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015, we reported the debt securities issued to the 
VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt with a carrying value 
of $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, and the preferred 
equity securities issued to the VIEs as preferred stock with a 
carrying value of $2.5 billion at both dates. These amounts are in 
addition to the involvements in these VIEs included in the 
preceding table. 
 
Loan Sales and Securitization Activity 
We periodically transfer consumer and CRE loans and other 
types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan sale 
transactions. We typically retain the servicing rights from these 
sales and may continue to hold other beneficial interests in the 
transferred financial assets. We may also provide liquidity to 
investors in the beneficial interests and credit enhancements in 
the form of standby letters of credit. Through these transfers we 
may be exposed to liability under limited amounts of recourse as 
well as standard representations and warranties we make to 
purchasers and issuers. Table 7.3 presents the cash flows for our 
transfers accounted for as sales. 

In Table 7.2, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining 

principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the 
most current information available. For VIEs that obtain 
exposure to assets synthetically through derivative instruments, 
the remaining notional amount of the derivative is included in 
the asset balance. “Carrying value” is the amount in our 
consolidated balance sheet related to our involvement with the 
unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure to loss” from our 
involvement with off-balance sheet entities, which is a required 
disclosure under GAAP, is determined as the carrying value of 
our involvement with off-balance sheet (unconsolidated) VIEs 
plus the remaining undrawn liquidity and lending commitments, 
the notional amount of net written derivative contracts, and 
generally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, 
other commitments and guarantees. It represents estimated loss 
that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, 
for which we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as 
where the value of our interests and any associated collateral 
declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset 
from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this required disclosure 
is not an indication of expected loss. 

For complete descriptions of our types of transactions with 

unconsolidated VIEs with which we have a significant continuing 
involvement, but we are not the primary beneficiary, see Note 8 
(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial 
Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

INVESTMENT FUNDS  In first quarter 2016, we adopted ASU 
2015-02 (Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis) which 
changed the consolidation analysis for certain investment funds. 
We do not consolidate these investment funds because we do not 
hold variable interests that are considered significant to the 
funds.

 We voluntarily waived a portion of our management fees for 

certain money market funds that are exempt from the 
consolidation analysis to ensure the funds maintained a 
minimum level of daily net investment income. The amount of 
fees waived in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 was 
$28 million and $84 million, respectively, compared with 
$50 million and $159 million, respectively, in the same periods of 
2015. 

OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH VIEs  Other VIEs include 
certain entities that issue auction rate securities (ARS) which are 
debt instruments with long-term maturities, that re-price more 
frequently, and preferred equities with no maturity. At 
September 30, 2016, we held $453 million of ARS issued by VIEs 
compared with $502 million at December 31, 2015. We acquired 
the ARS pursuant to agreements entered into in 2008 and 2009. 
We do not consolidate the VIEs that issued the ARS because 

we do not have power over the activities of the VIEs.

(1) 	 Cash flows from other interests held include principal and interest payments received on retained bonds and excess cash flows received on interest-only strips. 
(2) 	 Consists of cash paid to repurchase loans from investors and cash paid to investors to reimburse them for losses on individual loans that are already liquidated. 
(3) 	 Represent loans repurchased from GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC under representation and warranty provisions included in our loan sales contracts. Third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016 exclude $2.4 billion and $7.3 billion respectively, in delinquent insured/guaranteed loans that we service and have exercised our option to purchase out of 
GNMA pools, compared with $2.2 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, in the same periods of 2015. These loans are predominantly insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the 
VA. 

In the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, we 

recognized net gains of $141 million and $436 million, 
respectively, from transfers accounted for as sales of financial 
assets, compared with $88 million and $404 million, 
respectively, in the same periods of 2015. These net gains largely 
relate to commercial mortgage securitizations and residential 
mortgage securitizations where the loans were not already carried 
at fair value. 

Sales with continuing involvement during the third quarter 

and first nine months of 2016 and 2015 largely related to 
securitizations of residential mortgages that are sold to the 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs), including FNMA, 
FHLMC and GNMA (conforming residential mortgage 
securitizations). During the third quarter and first nine months of 
2016, we transferred $63.3 billion and $165.6 billion, 
respectively, in fair value of residential mortgages to 
unconsolidated VIEs and third-party investors and recorded the 
transfers as sales, compared with $50.2 billion and $143.1 billion, 
respectively, in the same periods of 2015. Substantially all of 
these transfers did not result in a gain or loss because the loans 
were already carried at fair value. In connection with all of these 
transfers, in the first nine months of 2016, we recorded a $1.3 
billion servicing asset, measured at fair value using a Level 3 
measurement technique, securities of $3.0 billion, classified as 
Level 2, and a $26 million liability for repurchase losses which 
reflects management’s estimate of probable losses related to 
various representations and warranties for the loans transferred, 
initially measured at fair value. In the first nine months of 2015, 
we recorded a $1.2 billion servicing asset, securities of $787 
million, and a $34 million liability. 

Table 7.4 presents the key weighted-average assumptions we 
used to measure residential mortgage servicing rights at the date 
of securitization.

(1) 	 The prepayment speed assumption for residential mortgage servicing rights 
includes a blend of prepayment speeds and default rates. Prepayment speed 
assumptions are influenced by mortgage interest rate inputs as well as our 
estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 
Includes costs to service and unreimbursed foreclosure costs, which can vary 
period to period depending on the mix of modified government-guaranteed 
loans sold to GNMA. 

(2) 	

During the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, we 

transferred $4.0 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively, in 
carrying value of commercial mortgages to unconsolidated VIEs 
and third-party investors and recorded the transfers as sales, 
compared with $3.0 billion and $12.5 billion in the same periods 
of 2015, respectively. These transfers resulted in gains of $134 
million and $327 million in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2016, respectively, because the loans were carried at 
lower of cost of market value (LOCOM), compared with gains of 
$63 million and $263 million in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2015, respectively. In connection with these transfers, 
in the first nine months of 2016, we recorded a servicing asset of 
$204 million, initially measured at fair value using a Level 3 
measurement technique, and securities of $236 million, classified 
as Level 2. In the first nine months of 2015, we recorded a 
servicing asset of $131 million and securities of $209 million. 

Retained Interests from Unconsolidated VIEs 
Table 7.5 provides key economic assumptions and the sensitivity 
of the current fair value of residential mortgage servicing rights 
and other interests held to immediate adverse changes in those 
assumptions. “Other interests held” relate to residential and 
commercial mortgage loan securitizations. Residential mortgage-
backed securities retained in securitizations issued through GSEs, 
such as FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA, are excluded from the table 
because these securities have a remote risk of credit loss due to 

 
Table 7.5:  Retained Interests from Unconsolidated VIEs 

  

the GSE guarantee. These securities also have economic 
characteristics similar to GSE mortgage-backed securities that we 
purchase, which are not included in the table. Subordinated 
interests include only those bonds whose credit rating was below 
AAA by a major rating agency at issuance. Senior interests 
include only those bonds whose credit rating was AAA by a major 
rating agency at issuance. The information presented excludes 
trading positions held in inventory.

(1) 	 See narrative following this table for a discussion of commercial mortgage servicing rights. 
(2) 	 Prepayment speed assumptions do not significantly impact the value of commercial mortgage securitization bonds as the underlying commercial mortgage loans experience 

significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions, impacting the borrower’s ability to prepay the mortgage. 

(3) 	 The prepayment speed assumption for residential mortgage servicing rights includes a blend of prepayment speeds and default rates. Prepayment speed assumptions are 

influenced by mortgage interest rate inputs as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior. 

109 

Note 7:  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities (continued) 

In addition to residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) 

included in the previous table, we have a small portfolio of 
commercial MSRs with a fair value of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion 
 
at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. The 
nature of our commercial MSRs, which are carried at LOCOM, is 
different from our residential MSRs. Prepayment activity on 
serviced loans does not significantly impact the value of 
commercial MSRs because, unlike residential mortgages, 
commercial mortgages experience significantly lower 
prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions, impacting 
the borrower’s ability to prepay the mortgage. Additionally, for 
our commercial MSR portfolio, we are typically master/primary 
servicer, but not the special servicer, who is separately 
responsible for the servicing and workout of delinquent and 
foreclosed loans. It is the special servicer, similar to our role as 
servicer of residential mortgage loans, who is affected by higher 
servicing and foreclosure costs due to an increase in delinquent 
and foreclosed loans. Accordingly, prepayment speeds and costs 
to service are not key assumptions for commercial MSRs as they 
do not significantly impact the valuation. The primary economic 
driver impacting the fair value of our commercial MSRs is 
forward interest rates, which are derived from market observable 
yield curves used to price capital markets instruments. Market 
interest rates significantly affect interest earned on custodial 
deposit balances. The sensitivity of the current fair value to an 
immediate adverse 25% change in the assumption about interest 
earned on deposit balances at September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015, results in a decrease in fair value of 
$183 million and $150 million, respectively. See Note 8 
(Mortgage Banking Activities) for further information on our 
commercial MSRs. 

We also have a loan to an unconsolidated third party VIE 

that we extended in fourth quarter 2014 in conjunction with our 
sale of government guaranteed student loans. The loan is carried 
at amortized cost and approximates fair value at September 30, 
2016, and December 31, 2015. The carrying amount of the loan at 
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, was $4.4 billion 
 
and $4.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of the loan 
is considered a Level 3 measurement that is determined using 

 
Table 7.6:  Off-Balance Sheet Loans Sold or Securitized 

  

discounted cash flows that are based on changes in the discount 
rate due to changes in the risk premium component (credit 
spreads). The primary economic assumption impacting the fair 
value of our loan is the discount rate. Changes in the credit loss 
assumption are not expected to affect the estimated fair value of 
the loan due to the government guarantee of the underlying 
collateral. The sensitivity of the current fair value to an 
immediate adverse increase of 200 basis points in the risk 
premium component of the discount rate assumption is a 
decrease in fair value of $93 million and $82 million at 
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The sensitivities in the preceding paragraphs and table are 

hypothetical and caution should be exercised when relying on 
this data. Changes in value based on variations in assumptions 
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the 
change in the assumption to the change in value may not be 
linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on 
the value of the other interests held is calculated independently 
without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in 
one factor may result in changes in others (for example, changes 
in prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in the 
credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the 
sensitivities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Loans 
Table 7.6 presents information about the principal balances of 
off-balance sheet loans that were sold or securitized, including 
residential mortgage loans sold to FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and 
other investors, for which we have some form of continuing 
involvement (including servicer). Delinquent loans include loans 
90 days or more past due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless of 
delinquency status. For loans sold or securitized where servicing 
is our only form of continuing involvement, we would only 
experience a loss if we were required to repurchase a delinquent 
loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and 
warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing contracts.

Transactions with Consolidated VIEs and Secured 
Borrowings 
Table 7.7 presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities for 
asset transfers accounted for as secured borrowings and 
involvements with consolidated VIEs. “Assets” are presented 
using GAAP measurement methods, which may include fair 
value, credit impairment or other adjustments, and therefore in 

some instances will differ from “Total VIE assets.” For VIEs that 
obtain exposure synthetically through derivative instruments, the 
remaining notional amount of the derivative is included in “Total 
VIE assets.” On the consolidated balance sheet, we separately 
disclose the consolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be 
used to settle the liabilities of those VIEs.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES  In 
conjunction with the GE Capital business acquisitions, on 
March 1, 2016, we acquired certain consolidated SPE entities. The 
most significant of these SPEs is a revolving master trust entity 
that purchases dealer floorplan loans and issues senior and 
subordinated notes. The senior notes are held by third parties 
and the subordinated notes and residual equity interests are held 
by us. At September 30, 2016, total assets held by the master 
trust were $6.9 billion and the outstanding senior notes were 
$2.7 billion. The other SPEs acquired include securitization term 
trust entities, which purchase vendor finance lease and loan 
assets and issue notes to investors, and a SPE that engages in 
leasing activities to specific vendors. At September 30, 2016, total 
assets held by these SPEs were $1.5 billion, with outstanding debt 
of $102 million. We are the primary beneficiary of these acquired 
SPEs due to our ability to direct the significant activities of the 
SPEs, such as our role as servicer, and because we hold variable 
interests that are considered significant. 

INVESTMENT FUNDS  Our adoption of ASU 2015-02 
(Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis) changed the 
consolidation analysis for certain investment funds. We 
consolidate certain investment funds because we have both the 
power to manage fund assets and hold variable interests that are 
considered significant. 

  

OTHER CONSOLIDATED VIE STRUCTURES  In addition to the 
structure types included in the previous table, at both 
September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had 
approximately $6.0 billion of private placement debt financing 
issued through a consolidated VIE. The issuance is classified as 
long-term debt in our consolidated financial statements. At 
September 30, 2016, we pledged approximately $457 million in 
loans (principal and interest eligible to be capitalized) and $5.8 
billion in available-for-sale securities to collateralize the VIE’s 
borrowings, compared with $529 million and $5.9 billion, 
respectively, at December 31, 2015. These assets were not 
transferred to the VIE, and accordingly we have excluded the VIE

from the previous table. 

For complete descriptions of our accounting for transfers 

accounted for as secured borrowings and involvements with 
consolidated VIEs, see Note 8 (Securitizations and Variable 
Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Note 8:  Mortgage Banking Activities 

Mortgage banking activities, included in the Community Banking 
and Wholesale Banking operating segments, consist of residential 
and commercial mortgage originations, sale activity and 
servicing. 

We apply the amortization method to commercial MSRs and 

apply the fair value method to residential MSRs. Table 8.1 
 
presents the changes in MSRs measured using the fair value 
method.

Note 8:  Mortgage Banking Activities (continued) 

Table 8.5 summarizes the changes in our liability for 

mortgage loan repurchase losses. This liability is in “Accrued 
expenses and other liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet 
and the provision for repurchase losses reduces net gains on 
mortgage loan origination/sales activities in “Mortgage banking” 
in our consolidated income statement. 

Because of the uncertainty in the various estimates 

underlying the mortgage repurchase liability, there is a range of 
losses in excess of the recorded mortgage repurchase liability that 
is reasonably possible. The estimate of the range of possible loss 
for representations and warranties does not represent a probable 

loss, and is based on currently available information, significant 
judgment, and a number of assumptions that are subject to 
change. The high end of this range of reasonably possible losses 
exceeded our recorded liability by $191 million at September 30, 
2016, and was determined based upon modifying the 
assumptions (particularly to assume significant changes in 
investor repurchase demand practices) used in our best estimate 
of probable loss to reflect what we believe to be the high end of 
reasonably possible adverse assumptions.

Note 9:  Intangible Assets (continued) 

For our goodwill impairment analysis, we allocate all of the 

goodwill to the individual operating segments. We identify 
reporting units that are one level below an operating segment 
(referred to as a component), and distinguish these reporting 
units based on how the segments and components are 
managed, taking into consideration the economic 
characteristics, nature of the products and customers of the 
components. At the time we acquire a business, we allocate 

goodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative 
fair value, and if we have a significant business reorganization, 
we may reallocate the goodwill. See Note 18 (Operating 
Segments) for further information on management reporting. 

Table 9.3 shows the allocation of goodwill to our reportable 

operating segments for purposes of goodwill impairment 
testing.

Note 10:  Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral 

Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make 
payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in 
an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are 
generally in the form of standby letters of credit, securities 
lending and other indemnifications, written put options, recourse 
obligations, and other types of arrangements. For complete 

descriptions of our guarantees, see Note 14 (Guarantees, Pledged 
Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form

(1) 	 Total maximum exposure to loss includes direct pay letters of credit (DPLCs) of $10.5 billion and $11.8 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 

respectively. We issue DPLCs to provide credit enhancements for certain bond issuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these instruments to make 
scheduled principal and interest payments, redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has occurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. We 
also originate multipurpose lending commitments under which borrowers have the option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including as a standby letter of 
credit. Total maximum exposure to loss includes the portion of these facilities for which we have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. 
Includes indemnifications provided to certain third-party clearing agents. Outstanding customer obligations under these arrangements were $187 million and $352 million 
 
with related collateral of $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $1.9 billion 
 
at September 30, 2016 and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2015. 

(2) 	

(3) 	 Written put options, which are in the form of derivatives, are also included in the derivative disclosures in Note 12 (Derivatives). Amounts for December 31, 2015 have 

been revised to include previously omitted contracts. 

(4) 	 Represent recourse provided, predominantly to the GSEs, on loans sold under various programs and arrangements. Under these arrangements, we repurchased $2 million 
 
and $4 million respectively, of loans associated with these agreements in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, and $2 million and $5 million in the same periods 
of 2015, respectively. 

(5) 	 Consists of guarantees made under certain factoring arrangements to purchase trade receivables from third parties, generally upon their request, if receivable debtors 

default on their payment obligations. 

“Maximum exposure to loss” and “Non-investment grade” 

are required disclosures under GAAP. Non-investment grade 
represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of 
being required to perform under the terms of the guarantee. If 
the underlying assets under the guarantee are non-investment 
grade (that is, an external rating that is below investment grade 
or an internal credit default grade that is equivalent to a below 
investment grade external rating), we consider the risk of 
performance to be high. Internal credit default grades are 
determined based upon the same credit policies that we use to 
evaluate the risk of payment or performance when making loans 
and other extensions of credit. These credit policies are further 
described in Note 5 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses). 

Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that 
would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, 
despite what we believe is its extremely remote possibility, where 
the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to 
zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table 10.1 do not 
reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or 
recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. 
Accordingly, this required disclosure is not an indication of 
expected loss. We believe the carrying value, which is either fair 
value for derivative-related products or the allowance for 
lending-related commitments, is more representative of our 
exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss.

Note 10:  Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral (continued) 

Pledged Assets 
As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge various 
assets to secure trust and public deposits, borrowings and letters 
of credit from the FHLB and FRB, securities sold under 
agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), securities 
lending arrangements, and for other purposes as required or 
permitted by law or insurance statutory requirements. The types 
of collateral we pledge include securities issued by federal 
agencies, GSEs, domestic and foreign companies and various 
commercial and consumer loans. Table 10.2 provides the total 
carrying amount of pledged assets by asset type and pledged off-

balance sheet securities for securities financings. The table 
excludes pledged consolidated VIE assets of $13.4 billion and 
$5.6 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 
respectively, which can only be used to settle the liabilities of 
those entities. The table also excludes $5.4 billion and $7.3 
billion in assets pledged in transactions accounted for as secured 
borrowings at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, 
respectively. See Note 7 (Securitizations and Variable Interest

Securities Financing Activities 
We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities 
borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities 
financing activities”) typically to finance trading positions 
(including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover 
short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing 
needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are 
conducted through our broker dealer subsidiaries and to a lesser 
extent through other bank entities. Most of our securities 
financing activities involve high quality, liquid securities such as 
U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities, and to 
a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities, 
corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for 
these transactions as collateralized financings in which we 
typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We believe 
these financing transactions generally do not have material credit 
risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring 
processes. 

OFFSETTING OF RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 
AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING 
AGREEMENTS  Table 10.3 presents resale and repurchase 
agreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) and 
securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to master 
securities lending agreements (MSLA). We account for

transactions subject to these agreements as collateralized 
financings, and those with a single counterparty are presented 
net on our balance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that 
permit balance sheet netting. Most transactions subject to these 
agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible 
for balance sheet netting. 

Collateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, such 

as securities or loans, and is not netted on the balance sheet 
against the related liability. Collateral we received includes 
securities or loans and is not recognized on our balance sheet. 
Collateral pledged or received may be increased or decreased over 
time to maintain certain contractual thresholds as the assets 
underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value. Generally, these 
agreements require collateral to exceed the asset or liability 
recognized on the balance sheet. The following table includes the 
amount of collateral pledged or received related to exposures 
subject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements 
are typically over-collateralized, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure in 
this table to limit the amount of such collateral to the amount of 
the related recognized asset or liability for each counterparty. 

In addition to the amounts included in Table 10.3, we also 

have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed 
in Note 12 (Derivatives).

Note 10:  Guarantees, Pledged Assets and Collateral (continued) 

  
REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS 
Securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities 
lending arrangements are effectively short-term collateralized 
borrowings. In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange 
for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an 
obligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction's 
maturity. These types of transactions create risks, including (1) 
the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, (2) 
the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below the 
amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and 
therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional 
amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity 

 
Table 10.4:  Underlying Collateral Types of Gross Obligations 

  

on demand requiring us to reacquire the security prior to 
contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks by the 
fact that most of our securities financing activities involve highly 
liquid securities, we underwrite and monitor the financial 
strength of our counterparties, we monitor the fair value of 
collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase 
amounts, and we monitor that our collateral is properly returned 
through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our 
cash repayment. Table 10.4 provides the underlying collateral 
types of our gross obligations under repurchase and securities 
lending agreements.

Note 11:  Legal Actions 

The following supplements our discussion of certain matters 
previously reported in Note 15 (Legal Actions) to Financial 
Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 11 (Legal Actions) to 
Financial Statements in our 2016 first and second quarter 
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for events occurring during 
third quarter 2016. 

MORTGAGE RELATED REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS 
Federal and state government agencies, including the United 
States Department of Justice, continue investigations or 
examinations of certain mortgage related practices of Wells 
Fargo and predecessor institutions. Wells Fargo, for itself and 
for predecessor institutions, has responded, and continues to 
respond, to requests from these agencies seeking information 
regarding the origination, underwriting and securitization of 
residential mortgages, including sub-prime mortgages. This 
includes discussions with various government agencies that 
are part of the RMBS Working Group of the Financial Fraud 
Enforcement Task Force in which potential theories of liability 
have been raised. Other financial institutions have entered into 
settlements with these agencies, the nature of which related to 
the specific activities of those financial institutions, including 
the imposition of significant financial penalties and remedial 
actions. 

  

ORDER OF POSTING LITIGATION  A series of putative class 
actions have been filed against Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Wells 
Fargo Bank, N.A., as well as many other banks, challenging the 
"high to low" order in which the banks post debit card 
transactions to consumer deposit accounts. There are currently 
several such cases pending against Wells Fargo Bank (including 
the Wachovia Bank cases to which Wells Fargo succeeded), most 
of which have been consolidated in multi-district litigation 
proceedings (the "MDL proceedings") in the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of Florida. The court in the MDL 
proceedings has certified a class of putative plaintiffs and Wells 
Fargo moved to compel arbitration of the claims of unnamed 
class members. The court denied these motions to compel 
arbitration on October 17, 2016. 

SALES PRACTICES MATTERS  Federal, state and local 
government agencies, including the United States Department 
of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission, and state attorneys general and prosecutors’ 
offices, as well as Congressional committees, have undertaken 
formal or informal inquiries, investigations or examinations 
arising out of certain sales practices of the Company that were 
the subject of settlements with the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney 
announced by the Company on September 8, 2016. The 
Company has responded, and continues to respond, to 
requests from a number of the foregoing seeking information 
regarding these sales practices and the circumstances of the 
settlements and related matters. A number of lawsuits have 
also been filed by non-governmental parties seeking damages 
or other remedies related to these sales practices. 

 

OUTLOOK  When establishing a liability for contingent litigation 
losses, the Company determines a range of potential losses for 
each matter that is both probable and estimable, and records the 
amount it considers to be the best estimate within the range. The 
high end of the range of reasonably possible potential litigation 
losses in excess of the Company’s liability for probable and 
estimable losses was approximately $1.7 billion as of 
September 30, 2016. The change in the high end of the range 
from June 30, 2016 related to a number of matters. It is 
inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or 
even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. Accordingly, 
there may be a range of possible losses in excess of the 
established liability or the range of reasonably possible loss. 
Wells Fargo is unable to determine whether the ultimate 
resolution of either the mortgage related regulatory 
investigations or the sales practices matters will have a material 
adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition. Based on 
information currently available, advice of counsel, available 
insurance coverage and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes 
that the eventual outcome of other actions against Wells Fargo 
and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, 
have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated 
financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate 
resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells 
Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.

Note 12:  Derivatives 

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including 
interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to 
assist customers with their risk management objectives. We 
designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in a 
qualifying hedge accounting relationship (fair value or cash flow 
hedge). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges 
that do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for 
customer accommodation trading, or other purposes. For more 
information on our derivative activities, see Note 16 (Derivatives) 
to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Table 12.1 presents the total notional or contractual amounts 
and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative transactions can be 

measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not 
recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when viewed in 
isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the 
instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged but 
is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments 
are determined. Derivatives designated as qualifying hedging 
instruments and economic hedges are recorded on the balance 
sheet at fair value in other assets or other liabilities. Customer 
accommodation trading and other derivatives are recorded on the 
balance sheet at fair value in trading assets, other assets or other 
liabilities.

billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, for certain derivatives that are combined for designation as a hedge on a single instrument. 
Includes economic hedge derivatives used to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, MHFS, loans, derivative loan commitments and other interests 
held.

(3) 	 Represents balance sheet netting of derivative asset and liability balances, related cash collateral and portfolio level counterparty valuation adjustments. See Table 12.2 for 

further information. 

122 

Balance sheet netting does not include non-cash collateral 
that we receive and pledge. For disclosure purposes, we present 
the fair value of this non-cash collateral in the column titled 
“Gross amounts not offset in consolidated balance sheet 
(Disclosure-only netting)” within the table. We determine and 
allocate the Disclosure-only netting amounts in the same manner 
as balance sheet netting amounts. 

The “Net amounts” column within Table 12.2 represents the 

aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after 
considering the balance sheet and Disclosure-only netting 
adjustments. We manage derivative exposure by monitoring the 
credit risk associated with each counterparty using counterparty 
specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements and 
obtaining collateral. Derivative contracts executed in over-the­
counter markets include bilateral contractual arrangements that 
are not cleared through a central clearing organization but are 
typically subject to master netting arrangements. The percentage 
of our bilateral derivative transactions outstanding at period end 
in such markets, based on gross fair value, is provided within the 
following table. Other derivative contracts executed in over-the­
counter or exchange-traded markets are settled through a central 
clearing organization and are excluded from this percentage. In 
addition to the netting amounts included in the table, we also 
have balance sheet netting related to resale and repurchase 
agreements that are disclosed within Note 10 (Guarantees, 
Pledged Assets and Collateral). 

Table 12.2 provides information on the gross fair values of 

derivative assets and liabilities, the balance sheet netting 
adjustments and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on 
our balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral associated 
with such arrangements. We execute substantially all of our 
derivative transactions under master netting arrangements. We 
reflect all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject 
to enforceable master netting arrangements on a net basis within 
the balance sheet. The “Gross amounts recognized” column in the 
following table includes $116.2 billion and $114.2 billion of gross 
derivative assets and liabilities, respectively, at September 30, 
2016, and $69.9 billion and $74.0 billion, respectively, at 
December 31, 2015, with counterparties subject to enforceable 
master netting arrangements that are carried on the balance 
sheet net of offsetting amounts. The remaining gross derivative 
assets and liabilities of $15.2 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, 
at September 30, 2016, and $14.6 billion and $5.9 billion, 
respectively, at December 31, 2015, include those with 
counterparties subject to master netting arrangements for which 
we have not assessed the enforceability because they are with 
counterparties where we do not currently have positions to offset, 
those subject to master netting arrangements where we have not 
been able to confirm the enforceability and those not subject to 
master netting arrangements. As such, we do not net derivative 
balances or collateral within the balance sheet for these 
counterparties. 

We determine the balance sheet netting adjustments based 
on the terms specified within each master netting arrangement. 
We disclose the balance sheet netting amounts within the column 
titled “Gross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet.” 
Balance sheet netting adjustments are determined at the 
counterparty level for which there may be multiple contract 
types. For disclosure purposes, we allocate these adjustments to 
the contract type for each counterparty proportionally based 
upon the “Gross amounts recognized” by counterparty. As a 
result, the net amounts disclosed by contract type may not 
represent the actual exposure upon settlement of the contracts.

(2) 	 Net derivative assets of $4.9 billion and $12.4 billion are classified in Trading assets at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. $13.9 billion and $5.3 
billion are classified in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. Net derivative liabilities are classified 
in Accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. 

(3) 	 Represents non-cash collateral pledged and received against derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty that are subject to enforceable master netting 

arrangements. U.S. GAAP does not permit netting of such non-cash collateral balances in the consolidated balance sheet but requires disclosure of these amounts. 

(4) 	 Represents derivatives executed in over-the-counter markets that are not settled through a central clearing organization. Over-the-counter percentages are calculated 

based on gross amounts recognized as of the respective balance sheet date. The remaining percentage represents derivatives settled through a central clearing

Fair Value Hedges 
We use derivatives to hedge against changes in fair value of 
certain financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt 
securities, mortgages held for sale, and long-term debt. For more 
information on fair value hedges, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to 
Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

 

Table 12.3 shows the net gains (losses) recognized in the 
income statement related to derivatives in fair value hedging 
relationships. The entire derivative gain or loss is included in the

assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge 
relationships, except for those involving foreign-currency 
denominated available-for-sale securities and long-term debt 
hedged with foreign currency forward derivatives for which the 
time value component of the derivative gain or loss related to the 
changes in the difference between the spot and forward price is 
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Cash Flow Hedges 
We use derivatives to hedge certain financial instruments against 
future interest rate increases and to limit the variability of cash 
flows on certain financial instruments due to changes in the 
benchmark interest rate. For more information on cash flow 
hedges, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in our 
2015 Form 10-K. 

Based upon current interest rates, we estimate that 

$887 million (pre tax) of deferred net gains on derivatives in OCI 
at September 30, 2016, will be reclassified into net interest

Note 12:  Derivatives (continued) 

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging 
Instruments 
We use economic hedges primarily to hedge the risk of changes in 
the fair value of certain residential MHFS, certain loans held for 
investment, residential MSRs measured at fair value, derivative 
loan commitments and other interests held. The resulting gain or 
loss on these economic hedge derivatives is reflected in mortgage 
banking noninterest income, net gains (losses) from equity 
investments and other noninterest income. 

The derivatives used to hedge MSRs measured at fair value, 

 
resulted in net derivative gains of $142 million and $2.6 billion in 
the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, and 
$1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in the third quarter and first nine 
months of 2015, respectively, which are included in mortgage 
banking noninterest income. The aggregate fair value of these 
derivatives was a net asset of $263 million at September 30, 
2016, and net liability of $3 million at December 31, 2015. The 
change in fair value of these derivatives for each period end is due 

 

 

to changes in the underlying market indices and interest rates as 
well as the purchase and sale of derivative financial instruments 
throughout the period as part of our dynamic MSR risk 
management process. 

Interest rate lock commitments for mortgage loans that we 

intend to sell are considered derivatives. The aggregate fair value 
of derivative loan commitments on the balance sheet was a net 
asset of $236 million and $56 million at September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in the caption 
“Interest rate contracts” under “Customer accommodation 
trading and other derivatives” in Table 12.1 in this Note. 

For more information on economic hedges and other 

derivatives, see Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in 
our 2015 Form 10-K. Table 12.5 shows the net gains recognized in 
the income statement related to derivatives not designated as 
hedging instruments.

Credit Derivatives 
Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is 
derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or 
entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to 
another party (the seller of credit protection). We use credit 
derivatives to assist customers with their risk management 
objectives. We may also use credit derivatives in structured 
product transactions or liquidity agreements written to special 
purpose vehicles. The maximum exposure of sold credit 
derivatives is managed through posted collateral, purchased 
credit derivatives and similar products in order to achieve our 
desired credit risk profile. This credit risk management provides 
an ability to recover a significant portion of any amounts that 
would be paid under the sold credit derivatives. We would be 

Table 12.6:  Sold and Purchased Credit Derivatives 

  

required to perform under sold credit derivatives in the event of 
default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include 
events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of 
principal and/or interest payment. In certain cases, other triggers 
may exist, such as the credit downgrade of the referenced 
obligors or the inability of the special purpose vehicle for which 
we have provided liquidity to obtain funding. 

Table 12.6 provides details of sold and purchased credit 

derivatives.

Protection sold represents the estimated maximum exposure 

to loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical 
circumstance, where the value of our interests and any associated 
collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery 
or offset from any economic hedges. We believe this hypothetical 
circumstance to be an extremely remote possibility and 
accordingly, this required disclosure is not an indication of 
expected loss. The amounts under non-investment grade 
represent the notional amounts of those credit derivatives on 
which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under 
the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the 
underlying assets. 

We consider the risk of performance to be high if the 

underlying assets under the credit derivative have an external 
rating that is below investment grade or an internal credit default 
grade that is equivalent thereto. We believe the net protection 
sold, which is representative of the net notional amount of 
protection sold and purchased with identical underlyings, in 
combination with other protection purchased, is more 
representative of our exposure to loss than either non-investment 
grade or protection sold. Other protection purchased represents 
additional protection, which may offset the exposure to loss for 
protection sold, that was not purchased with an identical 
underlying of the protection sold. 

127 

Note 12:  Derivatives (continued) 

Credit-Risk Contingent Features 
Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if 
the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain 
major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand 
additional collateral or require termination or replacement of 
derivative instruments in a net liability position. The aggregate 
fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk­
related contingent features that are in a net liability position was 
$13.7 billion at September 30, 2016, and $12.3 billion at 
December 31, 2015, for which we posted $10.2 billion and $8.8 
billion, respectively, in collateral in the normal course of 
business. If the credit rating of our debt had been downgraded 
below investment grade, which is the credit-risk-related 
contingent feature that if triggered requires the maximum 
amount of collateral to be posted, on September 30, 2016, or 
December 31, 2015, we would have been required to post 
additional collateral of $3.5 billion or $3.6 billion, respectively, or 
potentially settle the contract in an amount equal to its fair value. 
Some contracts require that we provide more collateral than the 
fair value of derivatives that are in a net liability position if a 
downgrade occurs. 
 

Counterparty Credit Risk 
By using derivatives, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk if 
counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as 
expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty 
credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on 
our balance sheet. The amounts reported as a derivative asset are 
derivative contracts in a gain position, and to the extent subject 
to legally enforceable master netting arrangements, net of 
derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty and cash 
collateral received. We minimize counterparty credit risk through 
credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master 
netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where 
appropriate. To the extent the master netting arrangements and 
other criteria meet the applicable requirements, including 
determining the legal enforceability of the arrangement, it is our 
policy to present derivative balances and related cash collateral 
amounts net on the balance sheet. We incorporate credit 
valuation adjustments (CVA) to reflect counterparty credit risk in 
determining the fair value of our derivatives. Such adjustments, 
which consider the effects of enforceable master netting 
agreements and collateral arrangements, reflect market-based 
views of the credit quality of each counterparty. Our CVA 
calculation is determined based on observed credit spreads in the 
credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit 
quality of the counterparties to our derivatives. 

128 

Note 13:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 

We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments 
to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value 
disclosures. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a 
recurring basis are presented in Table 13.2 in this Note. From 
time to time, we may be required to record fair value adjustments 
on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value 
adjustments typically involve application of LOCOM accounting 
or write-downs of individual assets. Assets recorded on a 
nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 13.14 in this Note. 

See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to 

Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K for discussion of 
how we determine fair value. For descriptions of the valuation 
methodologies we use for assets and liabilities recorded at fair 
value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating fair 
value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, 
see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial 
Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
 
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  We group our assets and liabilities 
measured at fair value in three levels based on the markets in 
which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the 
assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 
• 	

 

• 	

• 	

Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical 
instruments traded in active markets. 
Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar 
instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or 
similar instruments in markets that are not active, and 
model-based valuation techniques for which all significant 
assumptions are observable in the market. 
Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use 
significant assumptions that are not observable in the 
market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of 
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of 
option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and 
similar techniques. 

In accordance with new accounting guidance that we 

adopted effective January 1, 2016, we do not classify an 
investment in the fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published 
net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) that has been 
communicated to us as an investor as a practical expedient to 
measure fair value. We generally use NAV per share as the fair 
value measurement for certain nonmarketable equity fund 
investments. This guidance was required to be applied 
retrospectively. Accordingly, certain prior period fair value 
disclosures have been revised to conform with current period 
presentation. Marketable equity investments with published 
NAVs continue to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. 

Fair Value Measurements from Vendors 
For certain assets and liabilities, we obtain fair value 
measurements from vendors, which predominantly consist of 
third-party pricing services, and record the unadjusted fair value 
in our financial statements. For additional information, see Note 
17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements 
in our 2015 Form 10-K. Table 13.1. presents unadjusted fair value 
measurements provided by brokers or third-party pricing 
services by fair value hierarchy level. Fair value measurements 
obtained from brokers or third-party pricing services that we 
have adjusted to determine the fair value recorded in our 
financial statements are excluded from Table 13.1.

Changes in Fair Value Levels 
We monitor the availability of observable market data to assess 
the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the 
fair value hierarchy and transfer between Level 1, Level 2, and 
Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes but is not 
limited to quoted prices and market transactions. Changes in 
economic conditions or market liquidity generally will drive 
changes in availability of observable market data. Changes in 
availability of observable market data, which also may result in 

 
Table 13.3:  Transfers Between Fair Value Levels 

  

changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of 
transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. 

 

Transfers into and out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 are 

provided within Table 13.3 for the periods presented. The 
amounts reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the 
beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred.

Table 13.12 and Table 13.13 provide quantitative information 

about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable 
inputs used in the valuation of substantially all of our Level 3 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
for which we use an internal model. 

The significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and 
liabilities that are valued using fair values obtained from third 
party vendors are not included in the table, as the specific inputs 
applied are not provided by the vendor. In addition, the table 
excludes the valuation techniques and significant unobservable 
inputs for certain classes of Level 3 assets and liabilities 
measured using an internal model that we consider, both 
individually and in the aggregate, insignificant relative to our 
overall Level 3 assets and liabilities. We made this determination 

based upon an evaluation of each class, which considered the 
magnitude of the positions, nature of the unobservable inputs 
and potential for significant changes in fair value due to changes 
in those inputs. For information on how changes in significant 
unobservable inputs affect the fair values of Level 3 assets and 
liabilities, see Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to 
Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K.

Note 13:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

The valuation techniques used for our Level 3 assets and 
liabilities, as presented in the previous tables, are described as 
follows: 
•  Discounted cash flow – Discounted cash flow valuation 

 

 

techniques generally consist of developing an estimate of 
future cash flows that are expected to occur over the life of an 
instrument and then discounting those cash flows at a rate of 
return that results in the fair value amount. 

•  Market comparable pricing – Market comparable pricing 

 

valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of 
certain instruments by incorporating known inputs, such as 
recent transaction prices, pending transactions, or prices of 
other similar investments that require significant adjustment 
to reflect differences in instrument characteristics. 

 

•  Option model – Option model valuation techniques are 
generally used for instruments in which the holder has a 
contingent right or obligation based on the occurrence of a 
future event, such as the price of a referenced asset going 
above or below a predetermined strike price. Option models 
estimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by 
incorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price 
of the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. 
Vendor-priced  – Prices obtained from third party pricing 
vendors or brokers that are used to record the fair value of 
the asset or liability for which the related valuation technique 
and significant unobservable inputs are not provided. 

• 

 

• 

• 

 

Cost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a 
portfolio of loans, which includes estimates for 
unreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and 
foreclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing such 
loan portfolios. 
Credit spread – is the portion of the interest rate in excess of 
a benchmark interest rate, such as Overnight Index Swap 
(OIS), LIBOR or U.S. Treasury rates, that when applied to an 
investment captures changes in the obligor’s 
creditworthiness. 

 

•  Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not 

 

collecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a constant 
default rate (CDR). 

•  Discount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the 

 

 

present value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at the 
fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists of a 
benchmark rate component and a risk premium component. 
The benchmark rate component, for example, OIS, LIBOR or 
U.S. Treasury rates, is generally observable within the 
market and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time 
value of money. The risk premium component reflects the 
amount of compensation market participants require due to 
the uncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows 
resulting from risks such as credit and liquidity. 
Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans 
associated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio 
that are likely of not funding. 
Initial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the 
underlying loan, including the value attributable to the 
embedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of 
outstanding unpaid principal balance. 
Loss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual 
cash flows lost in the event of a default. 
Prepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted 
prepayments of principal of the related loan or debt 
instrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant 
prepayment rate (CPR). 

 

 

 

• 

• 

• 

• 

•  Utilization rate – is the estimated rate in which incremental 

 

• 

portions of existing reverse mortgage credit lines are 
expected to be drawn by borrowers, expressed as an 
annualized rate. 
 
Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is 
estimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time, 
expressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a 
period over time. 

•  Weighted average life – is the weighted average number of 

 

years an investment is expected to remain outstanding based 
on its expected cash flows, reflecting the estimated date the 
issuer will call or extend the maturity of the instrument or 
otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing of an 
instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not contractually 
fixed. 

Significant unobservable inputs presented in the previous 
tables are those we consider significant to the fair value of the 
Level 3 asset or liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be 
significant if by their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset 
or liability would be impacted by a predetermined percentage 
change. We also consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the 
instrument, type of valuation technique used, and the 
significance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs 
used within the valuation. Following is a description of the 
significant unobservable inputs provided in the table. 
 
• 	

 

Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to 
observed market data, such as a transaction price in order to 
reflect dissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, 
or other factors used within a market valuation approach, 
expressed as a percentage of an observed price. 
Conversion Factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a 
particular instrument may be exchanged for another 
instrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage 
change from a specified rate. 
Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument 
changing in price relative to another based on an established 
relationship, expressed as a percentage of relative change in 
price over a period over time.

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a 
Nonrecurring Basis 
We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets 
at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. 
These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of 

LOCOM accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Table 
13.14 provides the fair value hierarchy and carrying amount of all 
assets that were still held as of September 30, 2016, and 
December 31, 2015, and for which a nonrecurring fair value 
adjustment was recorded during the periods presented.

Note 13:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

Table 13.16 provides quantitative information about the 

valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in 
the valuation of substantially all of our Level 3 assets that are 
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using an internal 
model. The table is limited to financial instruments that had 
nonrecurring fair value adjustments during the periods 
presented. 

 
 
Table 13.16:  Valuation Techniques – Nonrecurring Basis 

  

We have excluded from the table classes of Level 3 assets 

measured using an internal model that we consider, both 
individually and in the aggregate, insignificant relative to our 
overall Level 3 nonrecurring measurements. We made this 
determination based upon an evaluation of each class that 
considered the magnitude of the positions, nature of the 
unobservable inputs and potential for significant changes in fair 
value due to changes in those inputs.

September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, and $35 million and $41 million of other mortgage loans that are not government insured/guaranteed at 
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
(4) 	 Applies only to non-government insured/guaranteed loans. 
(5) 	

Includes the impact on prepayment rate of expected defaults for government insured/guaranteed loans, which impact the frequency and timing of early resolution of loans. 

Alternative Investments 
We hold certain nonmarketable equity investments for which we 
use NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient for 
fair value measurements, including estimated fair values for 
investments accounted for under the cost method. The funds 
predominantly consist of private equity funds that invest in 
equity and debt securities issued by private and publicly-held 
companies in connection with leveraged buyouts, 
recapitalizations and expansion opportunities. The fair values of 
these investments and related unfunded commitments totaled 
$67 million and $52 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016, 
and $642 million and $144 million, respectively, at December 31, 
2015. The investments do not allow redemptions. We receive 
distributions as the underlying assets of the funds liquidate, 
 
which we expect to occur over the next 12 months. 

146 

Fair Value Option 
The fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only 
permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, 
to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with 
changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair 
value option to align the measurement model with how the 
financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity 
or accounting asymmetry. For more information, including the 
basis for our fair value option elections, see Note 17 (Fair Values 
of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial Statements in our 2015 
 
Form 10-K. 

Table 13.17 reflects differences between the fair value 

carrying amount of certain assets for which we have elected the 
fair value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal 
amount at maturity.

Note 13:  Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) 

The assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value 
option are initially measured at fair value. Gains and losses from 
initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are 
recognized in earnings. The changes in fair value related to initial 

measurement and subsequent changes in fair value included in 
earnings for these assets and liabilities measured at fair value are 
shown in Table 13.18 by income statement line item.

For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk gains 
or losses were derived principally by determining the change in 
fair value of the loans due to changes in the observable or implied 
credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less 
the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. For 

nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to 
instrument-specific credit risk. Table 13.19 shows the estimated 
gains and losses from earnings attributable to instrument-specific 
credit risk related to assets accounted for under the fair value 
option.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial 
Instruments 
Table 13.20 is a summary of fair value estimates for financial 
instruments, excluding financial instruments recorded at fair 
 
value on a recurring basis, as they are included within Table 13.2 
in this Note. The carrying amounts in the following table are 
recorded on the balance sheet under the indicated captions, 
except for nonmarketable equity investments, which are included 
in other assets. 

We have not included assets and liabilities that are not 

financial instruments in our disclosure, such as the value of the 
long-term relationships with our deposit, credit card and trust 
customers, amortized MSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill 
and other intangibles, deferred taxes and other liabilities. The 
total of the fair value calculations presented does not represent, 
and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of 
the Company.

In January 2016, we issued 40 million Depositary Shares, 

each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of Non-
Cumulative Perpetual Class A Preferred Stock, Series W, for an 
aggregate public offering price of $1.0 billion. In June 2016, we 
issued 46 million Depositary Shares, each representing a 
1/1,000th interest in a share of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Class 
A Preferred Stock, Series X, for an aggregate public offering price 
of $1.2 billion. 

See Note 7 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for 

additional information on our trust preferred securities. We do 
not have a commitment to issue Series H preferred stock.

Note 14:  Preferred Stock (continued) 

  
ESOP CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK  All 
shares of our ESOP Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock 
(ESOP Preferred Stock) were issued to a trustee acting on behalf 
of the Wells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (the 401(k) Plan). 
Dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock are cumulative from the 
date of initial issuance and are payable quarterly at annual rates 
based upon the year of issuance. Each share of ESOP Preferred 
Stock released from the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan is 
converted into shares of our common stock based on the stated 

value of the ESOP Preferred Stock and the then current market 
price of our common stock. The ESOP Preferred Stock is also 
convertible at the option of the holder at any time, unless 
previously redeemed. We have the option to redeem the ESOP 
Preferred Stock at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption 
price per share equal to the higher of (a) $1,000 per share plus 
accrued and unpaid dividends or (b) the fair market value, as 
defined in the Certificates of Designation for the ESOP Preferred 
Stock.

Note 15:  Employee Benefits 

We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit 
retirement plan called the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance 
Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of 
Wells Fargo. The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009, 
and no new benefits accrue after that date. Although not 
required, we made a $1.3 billion contribution to our Cash Balance 
Plan in August 2016, which decreased cash and our net Cash 
Balance Plan liability. The contribution also resulted in a re-
measurement of the Cash Balance Plan obligation and plan assets 
as of August 31, 2016. We used a discount rate of 3.50% for the 
re-measurement based on our consistent methodology of 

 
Table 15.1:  Net Periodic Benefit Cost 

  

determining our discount rate based upon the yields on multiple 
portfolios of bonds with maturity dates that closely match the 
estimated timing and amounts of the expected benefit payments 
for our plans. The remeasurement resulted in an increase to the 
pension obligation of $958 million and an increase to the fair 
value of plan assets of $511 million. Cumulative other 
comprehensive income decreased by $447 million pre-tax 
($279 million after tax) in third quarter 2016.

Note 18:  Operating Segments 

We have three reportable operating segments: Community 
Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment 
Management. We define our operating segments by product type 
and customer segment and their results are based on our 
management accounting process, for which there is no 
comprehensive, authoritative guidance equivalent to GAAP for 
financial accounting. The management accounting process 
measures the performance of the operating segments based on 

our management structure and is not necessarily comparable 
with similar information for other financial services companies. If 
the management structure and/or the allocation process changes, 
allocations, transfers and assignments may change. For a 
description of our operating segments, including the underlying 
management accounting process, see Note 24 (Operating 
Segments) to Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. Table 
18.1 presents our results by operating segment.

(1) 	

Includes the elimination of certain items that are included in more than one business segment, substantially all of which represents products and services for Wealth and 
Investment Management customers served through Community Banking distribution channels. 

(2) 	 Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of liabilities to fund those assets. Interest earned includes actual interest earned on 

segment assets and, if the segment has excess liabilities, interest credits for providing funding to other segments. The cost of liabilities includes interest expense on 
segment liabilities and, if the segment does not have enough liabilities to fund its assets, a funding charge based on the cost of excess liabilities from another segment. 

(3) 	 Represents segment net income (loss) for Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management segments and Wells Fargo net income for the 

consolidated company.

Note 19:  Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements 

The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to 
regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal 
bank regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve establishes capital 
requirements for the consolidated financial holding company, 
and the OCC has similar requirements for the Company’s 
national banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank). 

Table 19.1 presents regulatory capital information for Wells 
Fargo & Company and the Bank using Basel III, which increased 
minimum required capital ratios, and introduced a minimum 
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. We must report the lower of 
our CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratios calculated under the 
Standardized Approach and under the Advanced Approach in the 
assessment of our capital adequacy. The information presented 
reflects risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Standardized and 
Advanced Approaches with Transition Requirements. The 
Standardized Approach applies assigned risk weights to broad 
risk categories, while the calculation of RWAs under the 
Advanced Approach differs by requiring applicable banks to 

 
Table 19.1:  Regulatory Capital Information 

  

utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of 
internal credit models, and includes an operational risk 
component. The Basel III revised definition of capital, and 
changes are being phased-in effective January 1, 2014, through 
the end of 2021. 

The Bank is an approved seller/servicer of mortgage loans 

and is required to maintain minimum levels of shareholders’ 
equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United 
States Department of Housing and Urban Development, GNMA, 
FHLMC and FNMA. At September 30, 2016, the Bank met these 
requirements. Other subsidiaries, including the Company’s 
insurance and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are also subject to 
various minimum capital levels, as defined by applicable industry 
regulations. The minimum capital levels for these subsidiaries, 
and related restrictions, are not significant to our consolidated 
operations.
