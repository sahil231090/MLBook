    "# Digital Assistant: chat-bots\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots are virtual assistants that help customers transact or solve problems. These automated programmes use NLP to interact with clients in natural language (by text or voice), and use machine learning algorithms to improve over time. Chatbots are being introduced by a range of financial services firms, often in their mobile apps or social media. While many are still in the trial phase, there is potential for growth as chatbots gain increasing usage, especially among the younger generations, and become more sophisticated. The current generation of chatbots in use by financial services firms is simple, generally providing balance information or alerts to custom ers, or answering simple questions. It is worth observing that the increasing usage of chatbots is correlated with the increased usage of messaging applications.\n",

    "The focus of this case study are as follows:\n",
    "* Understand and build a chatbot\n",
    "* Understand the data preparation required for building a chatbot\n",

    "We know that text is messy. Acronyms, punctuation and spacing can make it hard for machines to infer. Let us focus on a situation where a client wants to know a particu lar financial metric for a company. Experienced users on Bloomberg know that they can get this information using special mnemonics and formulas. While it is always better is a user inquiry follows a standardized format, this should not be a require ment. Chatbots are an effective tool at trying to simplify input output between unsophisticated users and a machine. We have seen that digital assistants are able to infer, commands and accurately perform actions."

    "* Using the chatterbot library in Python allows us to built a simple interface to resolve user inputs. A series of custom Logic Adaptors can be used to construct a more sophisticated chatterbot. This can be generalized to more interesting tasks such as retrieving information from a database or asking for more input from the user.\n",
